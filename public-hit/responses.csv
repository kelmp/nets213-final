`Adrian`,`The bellows doesn't seem like it will fall apart, but the leather that encases the air that is supposed to go through the nozzle is now full of burnt through holes and is in need of patching or replacement before it can be used. (To move things along) Hymir and Absinthe use the healing spirit as well. 22 / 18 Everyone is at full health. There are several exits to this room aside from the way you came in.

`Adrian`,`Hymir hacks up a lung, tries to duck out of the way of a couple zombie flails, Attack: 21 Damage: 6 Attack: 23 Damage: 6 , taking 12 total damage, and falters in an attack on the NE zombie, sending the bolt harmlessly into the wall. But at least he catches his breath once he's clear of the ash cloud, ready to make his next round better. Krodmad ducks out of the way of the ash puff, which is easy because he's so low to the ground. Then he clambers over the bar which is a little taller than he is, and lands flat on the ground behind it. But he still manages to shoot a zombie in the face point blank. 4 The arrow goes through its skull and it slumps to the ground, any un-life it had now gone. Fjolnir Backs away out through the door since the zombie next to him was busy with slapping Hymir, and fires an arrow at both zombies there. Both arrows hit! Puffs of ash rise off of each one, and Az Emberi and Krodmad must now make a CON save, DC 10 , or suffer the Ash Puff ! Krodmad ducks under the effects of the ash cloud again, holding his breath until it settles. Absinthe takes Fjolnir's place in the room and swings with his not so trusty yklwa, and the zombie doesn't notice. However, the judo (whatever that is) chop to the neck hits some rotting muscle, snapping it and giving the zombie even more tilt than previously.  21- Az Emberi 17- Dirk (Suffering from ash puff) 16- Ash Zombie #1 (behind bar) Dead #2 (Top wall) Taken 10 damage #3 Taken 12 damage, looks... more damaged than the others. #4 Taken 5 damage 9- Hymir & Krodmad 8- Absinthe & Fjolnir Az Emberi and Dirk are up.

`Eric S`,`Dustfinger starts to stabilize. Dirk heals Absinthe for 8 total, (even though Dustfinger is making death saves...) Then uses his Mantle of Inspiration. Absinthe, Dustfinger , Fjolnir , and 1 more , gains 5 Temp HP, and can move up to their movement without provoking opportunity attacks. (Just noticed the wording of Mantle of Inspiration, the creatures have to be able to see you as well as you seeing them. Dustfinger is unconscious and can't see you, so he can't benefit from it. You can choose 2 more out of yourself, Hymir and Az Emberi to also gain a free move and Temp HP. If you pick yourself as one you won't get an opportunity attack from the zombie.) Az Emberi moves through the Healing Spirit before moving it onto Dustfinger's spot. (At the start of your next turn you will heal, then you may act on that turn... so long as Az doesn't lose concentration, mua ha ha!) He skirts around zombie #4 trying not to provoke an attack, and successfully hits the floating skull with a Thorn Whip. The piercing thorns do less damage than expected, though. You get the feeling that it is resistant to piercing damage. It is, however, pulled toward you, and is now less than 10 feet from the ground. Just remembered it needs to make a concentration check: 5 The flaming sphere dissipates... Before Hymir goes, I need clarification from Dirk, then I'll need where everyone wants to move with their free 30' of movement.
