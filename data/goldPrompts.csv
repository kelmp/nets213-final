Az Emberi listens at the cave to figure out useful info Perception 25
Absinthe bellows out a frightfully loud growl before changing towards the closest bugbear. "This is what you had up your sleeve?" Lightbringer Attack: 8 Damage: 10 Throat punch Attack: 16 Damage: 5 Ki point kick to stones Attack: 24 Damage: 5

`Az Emberi's stone smashes through the damaged one's spine, shattering its midsection and it crumples to the ground in a heap. Hymir climbs up on the stone coffin and casts burning hands on the other two skeletons. Flames engulf both of them 9 3 They both fail to get out of the way and take a full 9 damage each. Absinthe, Dirk and Fjolnir are up.`
Atk. 12 dmg. 8 Then I'll drop my flameblade and summon moon beam on his location. Con 14 or. 12 radiant. "He's there!" I move closer to him. Stay 10 feet away.
Attacking zombie 5 12 Damage 7 + Sneak Attack 3
I move to the door I wait for Dust to make his choice. Then I punch the ground and cast spike growth from the point I was standing at that should put each skeleton and myself in the spikes. I ba shillelagh and smack the head of the club in my free hand. Initiative. 3
`"Another stinking bugbear..." Fjolnir leans into the door jamb, nocks the second arrow pinched from his fingers, whispers a hunters' mark onto Grol, and looses an arrow while Absinthe tangles with him. Att: 20 Dmg: 9 Hunters Mark 1`
I move behind hymir and chuck a rock throgh the passage at the north goblin in the group of three Atk. 6 dmg. 8
`The bellows doesn't seem like it will fall apart, but the leather that encases the air that is supposed to go through the nozzle is now full of burnt through holes and is in need of patching or replacement before it can be used. (To move things along) Hymir and Absinthe use the healing spirit as well. 22 / 18 Everyone is at full health. There are several exits to this room aside from the way you came in. To the South is another way into the cavern of ghouls you've already cleared. The channel exits North and East, is 5' deep and can be climbed into or out of without an athletics check but is only 5' tall once it gets past the cavern walls. Most of you need to duck, Absinthe may need to crawl. There is also a carved passage to the East.`
I cast healing sprite on the area I occupy. A purpley translucent bird appears next to me it heals me for 1 It then flies over to ocupy dirks space using my ba healing him for 5 at the start of his turn.
`Hymir hacks up a lung, tries to duck out of the way of a couple zombie flails, Attack: 21 Damage: 6 Attack: 23 Damage: 6 , taking 12 total damage, and falters in an attack on the NE zombie, sending the bolt harmlessly into the wall. But at least he catches his breath once he's clear of the ash cloud, ready to make his next round better. Krodmad ducks out of the way of the ash puff, which is easy because he's so low to the ground. Then he clambers over the bar which is a little taller than he is, and lands flat on the ground behind it. But he still manages to shoot a zombie in the face point blank. 4 The arrow goes through its skull and it slumps to the ground, any un-life it had now gone. Fjolnir Backs away out through the door since the zombie next to him was busy with slapping Hymir, and fires an arrow at both zombies there. Both arrows hit! Puffs of ash rise off of each one, and Az Emberi and Krodmad must now make a CON save, DC 10 , or suffer the Ash Puff ! Krodmad ducks under the effects of the ash cloud again, holding his breath until it settles. Absinthe takes Fjolnir's place in the room and swings with his not so trusty yklwa, and the zombie doesn't notice. However, the judo (whatever that is) chop to the neck hits some rotting muscle, snapping it and giving the zombie even more tilt than previously.  21- Az Emberi 17- Dirk (Suffering from ash puff) 16- Ash Zombie #1 (behind bar) Dead #2 (Top wall) Taken 10 damage #3 Taken 12 damage, looks... more damaged than the others. #4 Taken 5 damage 9- Hymir & Krodmad 8- Absinthe & Fjolnir Az Emberi and Dirk are up. Remember Dirk, you have disadvantage on all your rolls, do to hacking up ash.`
Initiative 7
`I rush to Absinthe to cast lvl 2 cure wounds 9 I mean I charge forward, dash and take another shot at the worst off looking wolf. Attack: 5 Damage: 3`

Snarling I swing my club at R1 Attack 23 Dmg 10 Az Emberi leans back and howls then turns and runs over to r3
Absinthe let's out a groan of relief as he finishes scratching that magical spot between the ballsack and the taint. Moves to the north corner of the building and attempts to chip away at the nearest zombie/sprig/monster thing. Yklwa Attack: 11 Damage: 6 Upper cut Attack: 8 Damage: 3
Instinctively Vengeance! I say in the most mocking imitation of Venomfang.
I move into the hallway to the spider and ba cast flame blade. I swing at it 14 dmg. 10
Fjolnir trots over about 20 feet to the East and starts squealing arrows at the 2nd and 3rd revellers in the rotting conga line. Longbow 17 Dmg 11 Hordebreaker 8 Dmg 11
`"Unless I can make alcohol with anything in this room, I have no further interest in this cave let's get out of here before someone else comes."`
`After the team has finished their slumber party, Dustfinger summons his dancing lights again and shoots them down the unexplored hallway. One light above him, three others spread out down the hall 20' apart from each other as far as they can go.`
`The twig blights, as usual, don't carry anything. No one notices anything in the building you were headed to, either.`
`"NNnnnyope! Definitely feeling leery about the room you all are standing in as it is." I change my mind, but I'll camp closer to the bridge... probably give way and kill me anyway. Looking around anyway 6`
`Fjolnir grumbles to himself about the hard floor from sleeping while packing his bedroll back up and walks to the hallway- cautiously looking for anymore signs of ice landmines, animate snot, bladed clockwork, or the like. Stealth 8 Perception 6`
I quickly and quietly close the door if there's a way to lock it with the key I do. Initiative 8
`Absinthe, frightened by ghost 1, begins to rage and scream swings at the ghost with fury. Sword Attack: 20 Damage: 10 Punch Attack: 21 Damage: 5 Ki point punch Attack: 16 Damage: 7 "Rage!"`
`He draws another arrow from the quiver, "Who the **** is Seagal, another Monk?!" he says, while shaking the arrow violently as though it were defective, and quickly loosing it at the restrained creature. Attack 12 Damage 10`
`Tries it again, shortsword Attack: 11 Damage: 8 , dagger Attack: 18 Damage: 3`
`Critical hit, rolling all damage dice again (total 3d6, and adding 17 original damage) 28`
A most vicious mockery for this thing. You look and smell like ten tabaxians slap boxing in a pool of hot urine expelled from dwarves whose sole diet is artichoke and mango. A smell I would call sweet and ho. 3
`Fjolnir slaps his face, sighs, and rubs his nose and eye, before dragging his hand away disheveling his moustache. He hikes his belt up and heads out to the mouth of the discovered room to cover Dirk and Absinthe, palming a few arrows on the way.`
`Fjolnir loops his bow over his neck and pulls the dagger from his waist, draws the scimitar, and wildly swings at the brigand in front of him: Scimitar Atk. 10 Dmg. 5 Dagger Atk. 20 Dmg. 4`
`Fjolnir slips along the wall to the east side of the room and scans for anything else around to be used as a viable alternative to melee. Perception 10 Finding nothing, he sighs heavily- pulls hew from its lashing, closes the distance and swings to the fences. Hew 9 dmg 11`
`Dustfinger rushes up to Ab's left flank and Technoviking points toward the unfortunate Gog for whom the bell tolls. Their ringing fills the air, growing dread in every clang. Toll The Dead, Gog makes WIS save vs 14 or take 1 damage.`
