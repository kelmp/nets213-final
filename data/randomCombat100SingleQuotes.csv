"Between Dustfinger and Fjolnir's attacks on the thing, more damage was done, and it is starting to show signs of wear.

"With our inevitable doom in sight, Absinthe decides to go out doing the things he likes most. Punching and Grappling things. Absinthe takes a deep breath and in one swoop drops his robe. Standing completely naked with his stupid Yklwa in hand and Goliath dong just hanging out. 'May this be or may it not be my final battle! Or something like that!'

"Currently, all of you on the top deck see a multitude of large shapes surrounding the boat underwater. They appear fish-like in their movement, yet they seem to have arm-like limbs or fins toward the front. It's impossible to make out any more details through the waves, but they are keeping pace with the boat. Absinthe and Dustfinger, as well as the rest of the crew below deck, hears the captain's call to arms. 10 14 19 Notes: The rigging can be climbed without making any kind of check, it is around the mast and will allow you to cross the center of the ship to get to the other side without going around. You can make a ranged attack against any one of the creatures if you're above deck and against that side of the ship, but since they're a few feet underwater it will be at disadvantage. There are 9 dark shapes underwater on either side of the boat. Let me know if you would like to start from a different location, you can be anywhere on the boat. There are 2 people operating each boat-mounted weapon. If there is ever not 2 people on a weapon, it will not be able to fire. Anyone may take the place of a weapon operator if they fall, but for the most part the other guards lined up along the sides of the deck will take care of that. Mary, Garrett, and Gearbox are on the map and will act on their turns. Anyone, on their turn, can call out what you want them to do as a free action, otherwise they will act to the best of their abilities. However, now that they are aiding the party they can be targeted. Captain Miggetter, His first mate and bosun are on the map. The captain will be calling orders and keeping the ship on course, the other two will act as his bodyguards to make sure he can continue doing that.  Absinthe and Dirk are up. 21- Absinthe 19- Dirk 19- Gearbox 16- Captain and Mangonels 14- Mary 14- Fjolnir 12- Dustfinger 10- Garrett 9- First Mate and Bosun 8- Az Emberi 8- Guards 8- ??? 4- Ballistae"

"Absinthe attempts to squish the goblin with his torch, but it ducks the blow. He comes back with his other hand and actually does make his head squish. He goes over to hold his torch down the hole to the west, but it curves halfway down and he can't see all the way down. Fjolnir palms his arrow and his glancing around the room reveals no other living things. He doesn't notice any traps, but the fire pit looks dangerous. Secret DM Roll: 12 Everyone: Give me one shortish thing you'd like to do."
"Almost everyone missed their shots this round, except Dirk who is winning at life. He gets a stab on the one against the north wall. And Az Emberi saved Absinthe from a slow death, but other than that, suck. The one in combat with Dirk swings again, attempting to down the bard and end their trading of blows. Attack: 17 Damage: 8 It connects, knocking the bard to the ground. The one against the East wall raises its morning star to bring it down on the just awoken monk's head.

"Hymir gets a good angle on the zombie and botches his shot. Az Emberi whacks the zombie with his stick and anticipates the dust cloud coming off of it, succeeding in getting out of the effects.

"Fjolnir hands off a potion to Dustfinger, (Make sure to mark that on your sheets. Also, you can't technically hold a bonus action, only full actions. Bonus actions and movement must be done on your turn, the exception is holding a dash action. You can edit you post if you'd like.) Hymir readies firebolt for anything that appears in the hall, but try as he may, he can't see anything. Az Emberi heals Absinthe up a bit, and cannot see or smell or hear any sign of the spiders.

Round 4: Game of Cragmaw Absinthe make a death save. Dirk is up.
"Dirk gives Absinthe a bit of healing. Dustfinger stands ready. Absinthe tries to get ahead and punch something, but the webbing proves difficult to move through. He holds his attack as well. The two spiders reappear, one behind Dustfinger and one between Absinthe and Fjolnir, but before they get to strike, Dustfinger, Absinthe and Hymir release their readied actions. Absinthe slashes at the one that appeared behind him: Attack: 20 Damage: 7 and makes a small gash across it's backside. Dustfinger's flourishing attack slices off a mandible. Hymir's Firebolt chars a section of exoskeleton. The first spider attacks Dustfinger: Attack: 19 Damage: 11 / 8 But hits and destroys one of his duplicates. It then runs around to the other side of the pit. (Dustfinger used his reaction to use his held action, so no opportunity.) The second attacks Fjolnir: Attack: 21 Damage: 11 piercing, and Fjolnir must make a DC 11 CON Save or take 14 poison damage. (Then apply poison resistance again. I did not add any of the damage to your sheet yet.) A third phase spider runs out of a doorway in the hall, across the webs, bites at Absinthe, then phases out of the material plane. Attack: 10 Damage: 10 But in its haste it misses. Fjolnir must make his CON Save, then take his turn, and Hymir and Az Emberi are up.  Phase Spiders: Round 2 23- Dirk 22- Dustfinger (5/27 HP, 2 Mirror Image copies) 17- Absinthe (26/35 HP) 16- Phase Spiders 1) Taken 26 damage, Looks rough 2) Taken 12 damage 3) (Disappeared) 14- Fjolnir (28/44 HP) 14- Hymir 8- Az Emberi"

"Hymir commands his spider to move across the ceiling at Nezznar, then casts Earthen Grasp on the bugbear. 15 but it holds the fingers open and impedes the crushing blow. Az Emberi lashes out with a vine and catches Nezznar.

"Absinthe casually strolls out of the thicket back to the road, figuring this fight is over, and he's not going to catch the little chicken shit anyway. There's enough of the team throwing things at him, something has to hit. No, Absinthe 'Smashface' Stormbrew isn't really a closer. He doesn't chase cowards who refuse to stand their ground. He ain't about that life. He's a man of honor! He's a man of faith! He's a man who shoves goblin's heads up their asses! With relative ease, too. So there, on the Triboar Trail lies a goblin, head inside his rectal cavity like a reverse ouroboros. The remaining goblin, glancing back for a moment, enough to see this gruesome display, who was already fleeing in terror from the goliath, is now running while openly weeping. the frantic nature of his escape causes him to fumble a couple of times, but in between, he makes up the distance due to the increased threat of having his corpse desecrated like some disgusting plaything. Whether it was the sporadic movements, the fumbling, or the distraction of his own teammate taking a break from combat to perform a surgical procedure that ended in a goblin ring, Fjolnir threw the shot. Hymir flung another mote of flame, catching the goblin right in the shield. Scene: Triboar Trail runs East/West. You were headed East before the ambush. The dead horses are 50ft from where you parked the oxen and wagon. The trail is about 15ft wide with thickets that run up the slopes on either side.

"Having adventured with Az long enough, Dustfinger assumes some kind of nuke is about to go off and tries to creatively rescue Absinthe. He backs up five feet, while electricity arcs from his elbow down to his hand as he mutters his incantation, and he flings it out like a whip to snare the goliath and pull him away from the bugbear bukakke. The lightning loops around Absinthe and Dustfinger pulls, trying to reel him in to just in front of Fjolnir. Then Dustfinger Hexes the center bugbear in the back of the formation. (I've backed up 5' so Absinthe doesn't end up next to me to trigger damage. I don't know if he has to make a saving throw or if he can elect to fail it, but it's Strength vs 14. Hex is hexing Dex.)"

Dirk is on the edge of life, but you suspect he is still feigning death. Whether you want to oust him or keep up the ruse is up to you, but you feel that Dirk is doing it to **** with you.  Krodmad chases after the owlbear, and gets just North of the curtain to see it. He fires a shot even with limited visibility: Attack: 16 Damage: 10 and hits! It howls in pain. Owlbear has taken 54 damage, and looks rough. Absinthe and Hymir are up , then the owlbear again."

Fjolnir unfortunately misses his shot and curses under his breath about sphincters or something. Dustfinger thinks he hits with an eldritch blast, but it looks like he just hit between its arm and torso. After that, he realizes he has faced his fear and overcome it! Dirk insults the other one this time, for some effect. Absinthe focuses his rage on the one in front of him. With a solid hit from his sword and two connections with his fists, the ghost dissipates and fades into the ether. Az Emberi moves the moonbeam to the other ghost. 10 It starts burning in the light.

Everyone is up! 18- Hymir 26+5/30 HP 15- Dwarven Zombies AC: 8/ HP: 22 6) 1 HP 8) Taken 16 damage, looks hurt 13- Fjolnir 36+5/44 HP 13- Absinthe 19+1/35 HP 08- Flameskull- Ba doo be, shattered, shattered. Look at him, he's in tatters. 05- Dustfinger 4/27 HP (Has 3 duplicates) 04- Az Emberi 23/31 HP (C) Healing Spirit 04- Dirk 12+5 /27 HP"
"Az Emberi darts through the water, feeling natural in his new shark form, and bites the priestess in half. Fjolnir gets 2 arrows off at the other one, who is riding the shark, after moving his mark. Both hit the rider, for a total of 26 damage. The first mate and Bosun continue firing at the shark. Attack: 5 Damage: 8 / Attack: 11 Damage: 3 both miss due to the difficulty of firing underwater, even though the shark is glowing pink. The priestess atop the shark calls out to her fishy goddess, and brings forth a bolt of searing light through the water at Fjolnir, who just pelted her with arrows. Attack: 9 Damage: 20 but fails to connect with the powerful blow as Fjolnir swivels to the side. Absinthe is up! 19 Dirk 18/32 +5 (d6 Bardic Inspiration) 17 Dustfinger 10/33 +5 16 Guards (Holding Attacks) 16 Sahuagin Baron 13 Captain & Keel Breaker (Taken 96 damage to underside) 12 Az Emberi 34/38 +5 12 Fjolnir 30/54 +5 (C on Hunter's Mark) 12 First Mate & Bosun 11 Sahuagin Priestess #1 (1st: X 2nd: X 3rd: XXX) (Taken 26 damage, looks hurt, Faerie Fired, Hunter's Marked) #2 Dead 10 Sahuagin 9 Absinthe 23/43 9 Garrett (1st [X][][][] / Inspirations: [X][X][X]) 8 Giant Shark (Taken 48 damage, Faerie Fired, Hexed INT) 7 Mary (C on Hex, 3rd: [X][X]) 2 Gearbox"
"Dustfinger swears, knowing something like this would happen. He drops concentration on Hex so he can cover the area all around where Az is moonbeaming with faerie fire. (Dex vs 14) 'BLOCK THE DOORS! GIVE HIM NO WAY OUT!' Dusty is overcome with a particular ferocity to see this drow dead, but it's nothing personal. Drow just really hate each other."
Absinthe starts stomping on orc 5 Stomp Attack: 13 Damage: 7 Second Stomp Attack: 16 Damage: 6 Then proceeds to shackle the leader.
Goblin CON save: 16 It coughs but the poison has no effect otherwise. Fjolnir go ahead and make a perception roll in case the goblin is dead.
i high five my self then my spider that is painted to look mechanical
I examine the hole in the south wall
"Boop! I manage to touch absinthe from my web with L1 cure wounds 7 I know I should get out of this, but it's actually quite comfortable. Guys guys, come on in the room, don't be rude now. Mantle of inspiration on Absinthe, Az, Fjolnir and dust. Soak up that +5 hp yall. (marked my uses)"
"Absinthe charges headlong into the fray, as he does. He closes a significant distance, much to the surprise of the hobgoblins marching in the party's direction. The wolves, at first simply running forward, focus on the giant of a man now closest to them, and dash to meet him. 19- Absinthe / 120' away from hobgoblins / 30' away from wolves 15- Dirk 15- Wolves / AC 13 / HP 11 / 110' away from party 1) 2) 14- Hymir 12- Az Emberi 8- Fjolnir 7- Hobgoblins / AC 18 / HP 11 / 200' away 1) 2) Targor) Taken 5 damage. 3) 5- Dustfinger Dirk, Hymir and Fjolnir are up! Az Emberi hears the sounds of combat and rushes to an exit (I'll let you decide which one, but it'll take your turn to get there. You are still unseen to them.)"
"based on my insight roll i will untie him but his legs are still bound and he still has his manacles so should still be retrained as far as movement goes i yell out to the camp just load enough for everyone to hear me ' Prisoner untied, Heard? ' waiting for acknowledgement and i ready my action which will be slapping him in the face with wolf mean that i will use a a conductor from my fists"
"Fjolnir recieves healing 3 , and steps forward through the door, and to the left of Az- ready's a shot for anything aggressive to rear its head in the hallway."
"Fjolnir dashes to the second-southernmost rope to his immediate west, shouldering his longbow, and heaving Hew from overhead, down onto the rope along its iron stake. Hew 9 Dmg 6"
"Az Emberi's Spike Growth stabs up through the cultists' feet before they're able to stop running. 4 Fjolnir utters his incantation, misses his first shot but squarely connects with the second. An instant later thorns burst from the arrow embedded in the cultist's corpse and forces the adjacent ones to dodge the hail of thorns: 4 4 18 7 5 Cultists: Favric) Taken 8 damage 2) Taken 4 damage 3) DED 4) Taken 6 damage, looks hurt 5) Taken 8 damage, looks rough 6) Taken 8 damage, looks rough Dirk moves back to the cottage and uses a Faerie Fire spell to encompass all of the cultists. 13 9 8 18 17 Two of them fail to get out of the way in time, and are encased in a gay purple light. Favric yells in response to Krodmad's message. 'Serving beneath a dragon is the zenith of life! We will be honored to be in it's presence. Great dragon we offer these morsels to you as tribute!' Then he pauses for Absinthe's limp-fisted taunting and looks at all his people, 'None of us have children.' They all use a dash action to get out of the ring of spikes and around it through the bushes, but don't make it far.  Hymir and Az Emberi are up."
"Zhermong you have earned your prize and your life you will get no apology for what i had to do but whether it means anything to you, you have earned my respect as well. i trust you will make good on your side safe passage for you to leave and us to pass through. i would like to be on gaurd in case he attacks me and i would like to ready an action to prevent Sidar or anyone from attacking or taking his sword. we did it gents we can rest easy."
"Dirk slings vicious insults at one of the ghosts. WIS Save: 11 The ghost is visibly upset. Absinthe slices through the ghost with his sword which makes it wince with pain but its ethereal form repairs itself. The punch connects but doesn't have the impact that punches usually do. Az Emberi goes wolfy and brings down a radiant beam of light on the ghost. CON Save: 14 It resists the brunt of it but is still shaken, and its form is not held together quite as well anymore. The ghost on the left slowly floats to the edge of the top level. It then contorts its face into a Horrifying Visage, accompanied by a loud scream. The scream / visage combo is enough to make you want to run away. Everyone must make a WIS Save DC 13 or be Frightened . (A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.) The ghost on the right looks into Absinthe's soul. A sickly smile comes across its lips, and it reaches its hand inside Absinthe's chest cavity. Absinthe must also make a CHA Save DC 13 , then the ghost will finish its turn. Round 1: Ghost Guards 23- Hymir (Bardic Inspiration) 17- Fjolnir (Hunter's Mark on #2) 14- Dustfinger (Mirror Image: 3 copies) 7- Dirk (Invisible) 5- Absinthe 4- Az Emberi (Gone Wolfy) 4- Ghosts 1) Taken 2 damage 2) Taken 30 damage (Looks hurt)"
"'CHARGE!' I exclaim, as I charge in at the closest zombie. Yklwa Attack: 6 Damage: 6 Throat punch Attack: 18 Damage: 4 Ki point backhand Attack: 21 Damage: 7 If I kill the first one, just send the pain down the line."
"What should've been a finishing move for the party ended up being an utter failure, as Hymir, Dirk and Absinthe all miss their targets. Hymir had too much to get around and misjudged the shot, as did Dirk. Absinthe moved past Az Emebri into the room, skirting around the spikes, and flung a dart that just barely missed. (I did add your 9 health back for shrugged damage) The two skeletons, unclear as to why they are still standing, draw and fire, one at Absinthe and one at Az Emberi. vs. Absinthe: Attack: 23 Damage: 3 vs. Az: Attack: 21 Damage: 8 Both hit, these skeletons must be elite. (Damage applied) Az Emberi, Fjolnir, Dustfinger, you're up! 21- Fjolnir 18- Dustfinger 15- Hymir 11- Dirk 10- Absinthe 8- Skeletons AC 13 1) Taken 9 damage, looks rough. 2) Taken 10 damage, looks rough. 3- Az Emberi"
