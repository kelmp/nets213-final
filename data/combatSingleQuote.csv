Initiative: 4 Ballsack
Holy shit 10

"To the goblin that stabbed me, 'I believe when this is all over I am going to cram what's left of your crushed skull up your rectum!'"
Goblins 18
'What the hell do you idiots think you are doing? We're bringing supplies you maroons!' Attempt to convince them they aren't supposed to attack us.
"The Goblins, screaming with joy at their successful tactics, continue the assault. The two flanking Absinthe jump around while swinging with their scimitars: 10 19 The one behind slashes his meaty thigh, doing 4 slashing The two now visible little shits in the bushes fire more arrows, one at Fjolnir 17 and one at Dirk 16 Fjolnir is struck again, receiving 5 piercing damage. The order of initiative is: Goblins Fjolnir Hymir Dirk Az Emeri Absynthe Since you all go with no enemies between you, you may post in any order and it will happen in order. One turn consists of a move, an action, and a bonus action if applicable. You also get 1 reaction per turn, that can happen when it's not your turn. An action can be an attack, a dash which is basically another move, and myriad other things that are in the handbook, I can list if you want. You can also choose to do non-lethal damage, so if you hit something it with enough damage to kill it, it is knocked unconscious instead. Going to edit this post for damage if need be, hopefully it won't **** up."
Saving Throw: 17 Attempt to immediately return fire to screaming little green shit.
"OK, from now on we'll do this: Example: Roll attack 19 and damage at the same time 3 because when you edit a post with rolls and add more rolls some of the values change. That being said, Absinthe is down unconscious unless he rolls 7 or higher on a d12, and Fjolnir is close.... at 1 maybe?"
i move to Smashface I cast Cure wounds on smashface 10 I cast Shillilagh on my club as a Bonus Action
Ignore this post...
Stone Endurance: 6 Then I'm going to ball up my fist and bring it down on the one that hit me like I'm forging a sword and his head is the anvil. Punch: 15 Damage: 6 If he is still alive I'm going to come under him with my other fist and upper cut his hopefully already ****ed up face. Punch: 17 Damage: 4
"Crouches, nocks an arrow and looses it at green motherless **** on left side of the road. Attack: 13 Damage: 4"
I look at these creatures and I cast ... as i tell out to the heavens.... MAGIC MISSILES!!! 1st the goblin that got hit if it didnt die I would like to continue doing magic missiles to that goblin until dead but if not then The next 2 to the other goblin with a scimitar 5 3 3
7 to deceive!
"Smashface, even through his training, endurance, and will to fight, was not prepared for the quick assault from these knee-high ****s, and they toppled his tall ass. Everything went dark and he slammed into the ground with a loud THUD. Fjolnir takes two arrows in succession, one to the thigh and one to the abdomen, and is looking pretty rough. He saw they came from the same goblin, and being a BAMF, knew that one had to die first. Pushing through the pain he focused and let an arrow fly, striking the little green ******* in the shoulder, and it let loose a horrid high pitched squeal, but didn't fall. Hymir sees the arrow strike the goblin to the north and takes the opportunity to finish it off with a MAGIC MISSILE! As the three magical darts spring forth from the sage's hand, he knows that it will only take one to finish off the previously ARROWED gobbo, and sends the other two to the one that laid the last blow to Absinthe. All three darts strike two separate goblins simultaneously, and both are knocked off their feet, sent sprawling with a forceful magical blow. One disappears into the thicket, the other face-plants into the trail's dirt next to Absinthe. Scene: Triboar Trail runs East/West. You were headed East before the ambush. The dead horses are 50ft from where you parked the oxen and wagon. The trail is about 15ft wide with thickets that run up the slopes on either side. Goblin 1: Full health, in melee with an unconscious absinthe Goblin 2: Dead on the trail. Goblin 3: Full health, 30ft South of the road, in thickets Goblin4: Dead in the North thickets. Fjolnir: 2 HP, 30ft west of horses Hymir: Near Fjolnir Dirk: Az Emeri: Absynthe:"
"The two remaining goblins hiss at Dirk's attempt to trick them, so he drew his rapier and charged the one in melee with Absinthe, (He wouldn't have been able to reach the remaining archer) with a playful poke, 21 potential damage 3"
"...He hits! The goblin's arm has a brand new hole. Az Emeri thinks quickly and runs to Absinthe with a Cure Wounds, and readies their beating stick with magical power. The Goliath jumps to his feet, now full health, the slashes from the scimitars sealing shut. He smiles down at the marauding little goblin and with a closed fist, smashes the top of its skull in. It slumps lifeless to the ground, and Absinthe looks around for another face to smash. He sees the last of the 4 goblins up the hill a little ways, but can't make it all the way to him, since he was just layed out flat. (Standing up from prone takes half your movement.) The last goblin, having just seen its cohorts fall in a matter of seconds, has an expression of terror and sprints down through the thicket, skirting around the goliath out of deadly melee range, runs across the road and up the hill on the North side. They make it only part way up. Scene: Triboar Trail runs East/West. You were headed East before the ambush. The dead horses are 50ft from where you parked the oxen and wagon. The trail is about 15ft wide with thickets that run up the slopes on either side. Goblin 1 and 2: Dead on the trail Goblin 3: Full health, 15ft North of the road, in thickets Goblin4: Dead in the North thickets Fjolnir: 2 HP, 30ft west of horses Hymir: Near Fjolnir Dirk: Near the dead horses and goblins on the trail Az Emeri: Near the dead horses and goblins on the trail Absynthe: South of the trail in the thickets Fjolnir is up!"
Gleefully 'It's been weeks since I penetrated something this soundly. I'm always stoking for a good poking' with an over the top wink at Az Emeri
On my next attack I will cast my cantrip fire bolt with non lethal damage 'I have questions and although I aim to not kill this will not be pleasant' 22 3
Cast magic stones as a bonus action. Move closer up to thirty feet to get in range. I throw a rock for non lethal 14 attack 9 damage.
"Breaks the last arrow shaft to clear his draw, licks the broadhead, nocks and looses an arrow at the fleeing sentient booger. 7"
Attack: 15 Damage: Unable to parse dice roll. for one boomerang to the head..... assuming I filled that out correctly.
"Staring down the goblin that shot him was one thing, trying to hit the one running in a full sprint is apparently quite another, as Fjolnir's arrow misses its mark. Hymir, however, calculates the fleeing archer's speed and arcs a small bolt of flame in the goblin's path, striking him in the side and staggering him for a second, but not enough to stop him from running. Dirk manages to just barely bonk the side of the little bastard's head with his boomerang. 3 Striking the opposite side as Hymir's fireball, actually un-staggering it, and allowing it to stay forward on its path. Az Emeri magically infuses a rock, which flings out from him and glances off the side of the shield the goblin is carrying, having no effect. Scene: Triboar Trail runs East/West. You were headed East before the ambush. The dead horses are 50ft from where you parked the oxen and wagon. The trail is about 15ft wide with thickets that run up the slopes on either side. Goblin 1 and 2: Dead on the trail Goblin 3: Taken 6 damage, 15ft North of the road, in thickets Goblin4: Dead in the North thickets Fjolnir: 2 HP, 30ft west of horses Hymir: Near Fjolnir Dirk: Near the dead horses and goblins on the trail Az Emeri: Near the dead horses and goblins on the trail Absynthe: South of the trail in the thickets"
"Not wanting to see one get away- and at 35+' and opening, the dwarf runs a broadhead past his lips, nocks the arrow, squints and looses: 13"
"Attack: 22 Damage: 4 In case I have the opportunity to boomerang this varmant, I intend to knock him out... so I can interrogate."
Move another 30 feet Brain the gonlin if I get to him 15 dmg 4 If im not there i throw a second stone 14 dmg 5 Non lethal
Non lethal fire bolt Attack 14 Dmg 7
I'm going back to the dead goblin near the horses that stabbed me and I'm going to attempt to break his spine backwards so I may cram his head up his ass. Strength: 20
"Absinthe casually strolls out of the thicket back to the road, figuring this fight is over, and he's not going to catch the little chicken shit anyway. There's enough of the team throwing things at him, something has to hit. No, Absinthe 'Smashface' Stormbrew isn't really a closer. He doesn't chase cowards who refuse to stand their ground. He ain't about that life. He's a man of honor! He's a man of faith! He's a man who shoves goblin's heads up their asses! With relative ease, too. So there, on the Triboar Trail lies a goblin, head inside his rectal cavity like a reverse ouroboros. The remaining goblin, glancing back for a moment, enough to see this gruesome display, who was already fleeing in terror from the goliath, is now running while openly weeping. the frantic nature of his escape causes him to fumble a couple of times, but in between, he makes up the distance due to the increased threat of having his corpse desecrated like some disgusting plaything. Whether it was the sporadic movements, the fumbling, or the distraction of his own teammate taking a break from combat to perform a surgical procedure that ended in a goblin ring, Fjolnir threw the shot. Hymir flung another mote of flame, catching the goblin right in the shield. Scene: Triboar Trail runs East/West. You were headed East before the ambush. The dead horses are 50ft from where you parked the oxen and wagon. The trail is about 15ft wide with thickets that run up the slopes on either side. Goblin 1 and 2: Dead on the trail Goblin 3: Taken 6 damage, 75ft North of the road, past the thickets, cresting the top of the hill. Goblin4: Dead in the North thickets Fjolnir: 2 HP, 30ft west of horses Hymir: Near Fjolnir Dirk: Near the dead horses and goblins on the trail Az Emeri: Near the dead horses and goblins on the trail Absynthe: Near the dead horses and goblins on the trail, holding a 'goblin ring'"
On my turn I will carefully place the desecrated goblin corpse against a tree just off the trail to be displayed for any others who may think this a good place to set up for an ambush or any other ill intent. Then I will begin to drag the horses off the path so we may continue.
"Sorry I didn't do this sooner, but I'm going to roll Dirk's disadvantage with his long range dagger: 19 Running forward and throwing the dagger to give it momentum, the hilt of the dagger hits the goblin in the back of the head just before he crests the hill, potentially getting away. Combat is over, you can retrieve your thrown weapons, and collect half of your spent ammunition. Absinthe already expressed that he will drag the horses out of the way so the cart can move forward, what are the rest of you doing?"
I want to grab those 2 scimitar investigate the bodies then go to the goblin that almost got away .ake sure he is stable then drag his ass back to the caravan for questioning
"'I really thought that would work. Look at me guys, learning things about boomerangs' I almost excitedly proclaim, my voice flaring a little with mild excitment.' I collect my boomerang, dagger and search bodies extensively for valuables, trinkets and oddities. If no one objects, I would like to retrieve all the bodies, strip them naked and place them in a compromising position that I can describe if necessary, suffice to say lewd and disturbing with extra commentary."
I would like to investigate the spot where the horses were/are. 8 that was for investigation may I roll insight or perception instead? 20 insight 15 Perception
I only kind of object to what you plan to do with the bodies if it contradicts what I did with one already.
"This is a test, this is only a test... Ignore this testy test Attack: 16 Damage: 5"
"In fact does not push Hymir off any cliffs. 'Nothing to do but push forward am I right'? 17 'I want to sneak for safety, but at the same time I get the strong feeling we need to charge in... like now.... sorry everyone.'"
"I muster up all my stupid, stupid.... stupid. Draw my rapier and charge ahead roaring with beastial wrath. 'RRAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWRRRR!!' I will immediately threaten the first thing I see.... everything I see."
"Fjolnir walks at the same pace allowing Dirk to dart ahead. He doesn't want to draw attention, should this lunatic die, he still may remain hidden in a fracas. Initiative: 9"
"Based on the info Hymir gave, I yell 'we've been discovered.' My head bows my hair grows a little. Eye widen. Nose and teeth Elongate a snarl escapes. I snff the air deliberately Perception 19 Perception Advantage 9 Initiative 21 I climb the cave wall to get to the bridge above Athletics 4"
As the light rock flies past me I make my way forward to join in striking fear to the eyes of the goblins. Initiative: 14
attempt to climb to bridge with inspiration Athletic 18 Athletic advantage 18
"Az Emberi shifts into a half-wolf thing. Not quite werewolf, but close enough to be a little freaky, once the lights come on. He leaps up the wall to climb to the bridge in an attempt to catch the goblin Hymir heard from that direction, but the spray from the splashing stream made the rock wall unexpectedly slippery, and he landed back on the ground. Taking a more careful approach, they slowly climb the wall toward the bridge and make it 15 feet up. Hymir senses the urgency of the situation and throws his stone forward, illuminating the cave and finally allowing him and Absinthe to see. He moves forward, squeezing past Absinthe and Fjolnir to peek around the corner Eastward, keeping behind the wall for cover if needed. What he sees, and what everyone else hears, are two goblins at the top of the stream banging on a wall, or dam maybe? They notice him peek around the corner, now that it's lit, and speed up the banging process. Hymir looks around for any signs of secret switches or weak parts of the cave, paying special attention to the chance of a cave in as to not doom them all to and unfortunate end, and sees nothing of note, good or bad. Az Emberi notices a goblin walk back onto the bridge, make eye contact with him and run back down the path. He assumes this is the lookout that tipped off the rest of them. Dirk runs forward from the back of the party, yelling a battle cry, and makes it to a set of stairs leading into a large cavern with two pools of water and a waterfall that fuels the stream. A wide exit stands to the south. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear. He notices the two goblins beating on the dam, and also notices another one using a stalag-thing as cover. Rapier drawn.... Upon seeing the little shits he roars, 'ABANDON YOUR MISSION YOU FILTHY PECKS OR SUFFER THE FATE OF ALL YOUR KIN THAT FELL BY MY HAND! YOUR SCREAMS WILL ONLY BE HEARD FROM YOUR SOON TO BE EVISCERATED ASS HOLES!' But it seems to have no effect on any of them, as they all continue what they were doing. He then sings a little inspiring rhyme about a tiny mechanical device that could to Absinthe, hoping it will inspire him to.... could.... and hurls his boomerang at one of the goblins banging on the dam, because that needs to stop, and bonks him on the head. The goblin flips him off and continues banging on the dam. Absinthe runs up the path, now hearing more commotion and gets around the bend to the base of the stairs with Dirk. Seeing all the goblins, he moves forward again, getting in one of the goblin's faces that is hitting the dam. He smiles at it and cracks his knuckles in anticipation of its doom. Fjolnir tries to keep the advantage of staying hidden, but realizes it's impossible in this light, and moves up the path to get a good shot at the goblins. He lets off a shot, but it was not good. It goes wide and the goblin grins at him, like a little shit.  Az Emberi- 15ft up wall near bridge. Hymir- Near stream, under bridge Goblin 1) Taken 3 damage. Near dam Goblin 2) Near dam Goblin 3) In tunnel by bridge Goblin 4) Behind stalag-thing Dirk- At base of stairs Absinthe- In goblin 2's face Fjolnir- At the top of the stairs"
I climb the rest of the way up Athletics 14 Dash to get up 15 use remaining 20 feet of movement to close the gap on the goblin Cast Bonus Action Shillelagh Yell in gutteral growl 'III SEEE YOUU WOORRRM!' Intemidation 7
I move one square East of D unless that gives goblin 4 total cover as long as I can see him a little I'm good. I would like to cast magic missiles on G4 until dead the switch to G1 but if I have to choose all targets at once then the first 2 G4 and the last one G1 I yell with as much furry and possibly intimdation as possible 'Wizzard Spell!!!' 2 3 3
"Readjusting from the miss, he fires again at the First Goblin: Attack: 12 Damage: 3"
"Az Emberi continues climbing the wall after a moment of not finding good footing, and gets to the bridge safely. He takes a few steps down the path and yells at the goblin there, which makes it pause for a second, but other than that doesn't seem to scare it. Hymir Starts running up the steps with a lot of furry and yells about his wizzardness, and fires off 3 magical darts at the goblin behind the stalagmite. It drops dead. Goblin 3 strikes at Az Emberi with its scimitar Attack: 24 Damage: 10 Goblin 2 disengages (bonus action) with the goliath and runs south into the next room, out of sight. Goblin 1 Takes one more good whack at the dam. The barrier gives way and the passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above at Dirk! The bard must make a STR saving throw. Goblin 1 STR save: 1"
'Oh damn dam damn....' 9 'Shi....'
"Dirk, Goblin 1 and the light stone are all washed out of the cave with the rush of water. Dark and the goblin both take 4 Bludgeoning damage from getting knocked around the cave floor and walls, Dirk is prone, Goblin 1 is unconscious. Dirk, Fjolnir and Absinthe, you're up!"
"'They've scattered!' Fjolnir shouts, 'Light something!' He drops the strung bow around his neck, palms his dagger and draws the Goblin scimitar while darting around the corner to pinch the Third Goblin between Az Emberi and himself, immediately attacking him from behind. Scimitar: Attack: 3 Damage: 8 Dagger: Attack: 17 Damage: 5"
"Getting up 'Ughhh.... you..... You duplicitous Willow Chaser! Look at you. Look at your dumb ass.' I say as I approach G1 'I'm taking your shit' I search the goblin for anything, doubtful to be anything curative. Normally wouldn't be something I do, but I'm to near death and bitter, I stab that prick in the eye. 'Say hi to your family for me'"
"Absinthe lights a torch and begins to chase after goblin 2. I doubt I have the speed to catch him, so I move that direction but hug the wall. If I can peak around the corner I will."
"Dirk angrily stabs the goblin in the eye, making it dead. He then loots it. (add 1 Scimitar, Shield and Shortbow to your Character Sheet, instead of party loot, unless you wanted to put it in the pile outside, then I'll add it there.) Absinthe, seeing the goblin slink away and then losing sight of it, lights a torch and follows it to the stairs leading up in the south. He catches up to it at the top of the stairs and can see into the next portion of cave. Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder. There are two more goblins here, attempting to get behind the crates, and a 'big one,' and his wolf, caught in the middle of getting behind the stalag-thingy. 'You dare enter cave of Klarg? Klarg crush large intruder to mush! Get 'em, Ripper!' The wolf snarls. Klarg Initiative: 8 Ripper Initiative: 17  Fjolnir steps behind the goblin in the passage, sandwiching it between him and Az Emberi. He swings a little high with his scimitar, but stabs the goblin in the gut with his dagger. (Doing 3 damage, you don't add the ability modifier to off hand attacks unless you have a feat, but you would have added your +4 to hit bonus)  Az Emberi- 3 HP In passage, melee G3 Hymir- On stairs Goblin 1) Killed, repurposed to new room Goblin 2) In new room Goblin 3) Taken 3 damage. Sandwiched by Az Emberi and Fjolnir Goblin 4) Blasted, repurposed to new room Dirk- 2 HP, Flushed out of cave Ripper- In new room Absinthe- In goblin 2's rear Fjolnir- In passage, melee G3 Klarg- In new room Az Emberi and Hymir, You're up! Some secret DM shit I missed: 5"
I snarl and swing my club at the goblin Attack 8 Damage 5 I cast healing word on me as a bonus action 5
Hymir mixed with fear and adrenaline having just seen his new acquaintance which he had disagreements with but still considered a friend traumaticly swept away and with him being plunged back into terrifying darkness. Decides that for the first time in his life he has it a real challenge and could die. I run next to Absinthe as I run I vomit into my hand because I can barely process all these emotions. ..but then as I lock eyes with Klarg I feel a divine inspiration and using the vomit in my hand as a conduit I cast ray of sickness with DM advantage. Klarg makes a con save against DC 13 if it hits he takes dmg regardless but if he fails he is damaged and poisoned. Attack 10 10 Damage 3 1
"Az Emberi swings with his club, but the goblin dodges. He takes a moment to magically fix the gaping wound left by the thing. Hymir runs near Absinthe, hearing the declaration of Klarg, and through all his mixed emotions vomits profusely. Trying to catch it in his hand, he gets an idea to use it as a component in his Ray of Sickness spell, targeted at Klarg. Even with careful aim, though, he misses the big guy, and takes a second to contemplate the law of probability. The goblin sandwiched in the passage turns to strike at Fjolnir, since the wolf-person can't seem to hit anything. The goblin on the stairs turns around and swings at Absinthe, along with one goblin with a shortbow in the back. The other goblin with a shortbow attacks Hymir. Goblin attack rolls: G1 and G2 vs Absinthe: 22 14 Potential Damage: 5 6 G3 vs Fjolnir: 18 Potential Damage: 8 G4 vs Hymir: 19 Potential Damage: 5 Every. F-ing. Thing. Hit. (sorry that's a lot of damage) Absinthe passes out as a scimitar and an arrow hits him. Hymir and Fjolnir are low now, too. Dirk, you and the wolf have the same initiative, but you're up, and I'll post the wolf at the same time."
"I hobble my broken ass back into the cave, but take the first right as far as I can get into what I can only assume is the trash room. 'Listen you primitive screwball. We've torn through your ambush, torn through your defense here and you just tried to flush me out and I'm still back. There are only two ways this is going to go so I'm going to give you this once chance to surrender. We will turn you into the authorities but you live to fight another day. The alternative, is I walk my ass back up this cave and shove my foot so far up your ass I kick your damn teeth out.' 20 'Here I come.' I dash into the cave in the direction of my comrades.... funny, they are comrades now, just yesterday I would have cut and run if things got to hot..... I could die here."
Shrug damage 6
I Take another swing at the goblin 24 attack 6 Killing the Goblin I lose control hitting the corpse several more times as I shift back to my more human apperance. I sigh and say ' Humanity is hard sometimes.' I then move to Fjolnir to aid him on my next turn.
"Absinthe, feeling the darkness close around his vision, instead strengthens his resolve and forces himself to stay up, just in time for Ripper the wolf to charge and bite at his leg. Attack: 7 Damage: 7 It misses. Dirk runs back into the cave and yells threats through a garbage chute. (You still have an action if you want) Klarg looks around trying to figure out where the voice is coming from. 'Daddy?' Absinthe and Fjolnir, you're up."
"Absinthe, after shrugging of the arrow that caught him from across the room, looks down at the goblin that slashed him. 'MAY YOUR ANCESTORS BE WITNESS TO THE SHAME THAT IS YOUR LIFE... OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT!' Swings the torch like wielding a bat with one hand, as if the goblins head was the ball on a tee, trying get a home run. Attack: 22 Damage: 7 Then with my free action I want to stomp on the dogs head. Attack: 12 Damage: 4"
"With Az assailing the goblin behind, Fjolnir runs to several paces behind absinthe- draws the bow, nocks and fires an arrow at the wolf, from betwixt his legs. Attempt: 13 Damage 7"
"Dirk runs back around to the passage near the stream. Absinthe, with a lit torch, cracks the side of the goblin's head. The impact kills the thing dead, and it is now on fire, as the fire damage was extra. He stomps at the wolf biting at him but the wolf just barely dodges it. Fjolnir takes a chance and runs from the goblin, who swings with its scimitar Attack: 6 Damage: 6 but misses! Fjolnir is able to crouch behind Absinthe and fire his arrow from betwixt the giant-kin's legs, striking the wolf in the chest. Blood begins to soak its fur as the beast howls in pain. Who is that in there? Klarg peeks his head in the garbage hole. Ha ha ha! You try fool Klarg! Klarg too smart! Ripper! Klarg is interrupted by his wolf's cries of pain, and having wasted some time yelling back at a hole, runs from his hiding post and menaces at the dwarf that just shot his pet. Klarg skewer and eat little man like kebab! Az Emberi strikes at the goblin who mistakenly dismissed him, taking its life. He advances.  Az Emberi- 8 HP Hymir- 4 HP Goblin 1) Shortbow out Goblin 2) Dead, head on fire Goblin 3) Dead Goblin 4) Shortbow out Dirk- 2 HP Ripper- Taken 7 damage, Melee with Absinthe Absinthe- 4 HP Melee with Klarg and Ripper Fjolnir- 5 HP In passage, melee G3 Klarg- In Absinthe's face."
"having failed miserably a feeling of hate blinds me. I drop my arcane focus to the ground and take out both my scimitars and with a might roar yell 'BARBARIAN RAGE!!!' In Hope's to convince them that I am a barbarian, I dont know if that's an intimidation or deception or both i then attack Klarg with both weapons. Attack 19 potential damage 8 Second attack 22 potential damage 1 2"
"Hymir does a very un-wizard thing, but succeeds! He uses two scimitars to do a scissor-slash and hits Klarg's right arm. It cuts deep, he howls like his wolf did. That's going to leave a mark. (11 damage worth) The goblins do not change their targets, having proved successful last shot, G1 fires at Absinthe, G4 at Hymir. Absinthe takes an arrow to the knee. (down to 1 HP... Ouch!) Hymir takes one to the stomach. (Also down to 1 HP. Holy shit!) G1 vs Absinthe: Attack: 23 Damage: 3 G4 vs Hymir: Attack: 12 Damage: 3 Dirk Runs full speed around the bend, and manages to reunite with his newfound companions. (used movement and action to get there but you still have a bonus if you want) Ripper tries to earn its namesake on Absinthe's leg again. Attack: 6 Damage: 4 It fails, again. Absinthe and Fjolnir, you're up!"
"'If I live through this day I promise you Klarg, I will ride your body down the garbage shoot like a sled! Absinthe swings his torch at Klargs leg hoping that if it doesn't kill him it will knock him off balance. Attack: 21 Damage: 3 DM inspiration Attack: 17 Damage: 3 With my bonus action I spartan kick the wolf, looking for lift and distance. Attack: 23 Damage: 5"
"Absinthe connects with the torch, hitting his leg and also burning him slightly. (3 bludgeoning and also 1 fire damage. Taken 15 damage total) The kick catches the wolf under the chin. There's a crack, it appears that the jaw dislocates, and Ripper flips backwards and lands sprawled out a few feet back, lifeless."
"Fjolnir nocks another arrow and draws, 'Can you pray to your gods for a smaller ass?!' he leans as far to the side around Absinthe, sights up Klarg and looses an arrow at his ugly center-of-mass. Attack: 24 Damage 6 crit: 5"
"Klarg roars, Ripper! Klarg will crush you, You will gaa- he is cut off as an arrow hits him square in the chest and he starts to cough up blood. His anger immediately turns to fear as he starts to fall backwards... into a roll (Disengage Action) He hobbles over to the west side of the room with very labored breathing, each exhale spewing more blood, and makes a fumble for the garbage chute. Athletics 3 (LOL) You hear a Waaaaargh! OOF! 11 Az Emberi- 8 HP Hymir- 1 HP Goblin 1) Shortbow out Goblin 4) Shortbow out Dirk- 2 HP Ripper- Dead Absinthe- 1 HP Melee with Klarg and Ripper Fjolnir- 5 HP Klarg- Taken 35 damage Az EMberi and Hymir you're up."
having just taken an almost fatal amount of damage Hymir looks at Az Emberi and shakes his head no Dropping 1 scimitar putting the other back behind my back I pick up my arcane focus cough up a bit of blood while yelling 'Barbarian...Fire....Spell...of Rage' I cast fire bolt on G4 then I run to cover behind the stalagmite 2 West of where Az Emberi is/was Attack 22 potential damage 7
"almost dead, but not as close as others and woefully out of breath. I take a deep breath, whip out my lute and sing Az Emberi an inspiring song about a big red dog who lives a horribly decent life."
I move into range of goblin 1 scoop up 3 stones. Cast Magic Stones as ba Place one tenderly against my forehead and whip it at G1 Attack 8 Bardic 3 Dmg 6 I yell 'surrender or the second wont miss' Intimidation 12
"Az Emberi throws a magic rock at one of the goblins and it knocks it in the head. It looks pissed and points at you, making a sliding motion across its neck Hymir kills his though, no problem. Just a day in the life of a wizzbarian. The last remaining goblin is too blinded by his anger to notice he is the last remaining goblin. He looses an arrow at Az Emberi, the focus of his anger. Attack: 20 Damage: 3 A hit, albeit just a scratch. Dirk, Absinthe Fjolnir you're up!"
"I step forward to where Klarg was previously within 10 feet of the last goblin '.............' Stick two fingers down my throat and spew poison... just everywhere in it's general direction. 12 damage if he can't manage. Looks around.... 'Oh yea, sorry.... I can do that by the way.'"
"'I... have seen two grown men today...' Fjolnir nocks another arrow, sights the last goblin from between the wall and Absinthe...'...fight shit from the underdark-******* of the world'... and loose the arrow at the last goblin...

Perception: 22"
Goblin CON save: 16 It coughs but the poison has no effect otherwise. Fjolnir go ahead and make a perception roll in case the goblin is dead.
Absinthe calmly walks over to the last goblin in the room with a bloody smile on his face. 'Squish' he sais as he thumps him on the head with his torch. Attack: 19 Damage: 7 If he is dead already then I will go to the garbage chute and look down it to see if Klarg is lying at the bottom of it or if he got up and kept moving.
"Absinthe attempts to squish the goblin with his torch, but it ducks the blow. He comes back with his other hand and actually does make his head squish. He goes over to hold his torch down the hole to the west, but it curves halfway down and he can't see all the way down. Fjolnir palms his arrow and his glancing around the room reveals no other living things. He doesn't notice any traps, but the fire pit looks dangerous. Secret DM Roll: 12 Everyone: Give me one shortish thing you'd like to do."
"I dash straight towards the mouth if the cave which unless I see something on the way in which case as soon as I see a hostile I would like to stop and use an action if I can see it before I actually dash, should put me at the mouth of the cave able to see in that wolf's den and I'm looking for any signs of Klarg 'We cant let him get away!'"
I walk back to the second pool in hopes of finding a way to safely dump the water on a fleeing Klarg
"Tired, curious, the battle being over save for tracking down Klarg (a task I'll leave to others already on it) I explore across the bridge. I'm looking for a lost human I think, and treasures.... maybe traps... we'll see if I'm paying enough attention."
"Fjolnir shouts out to everyone, 'Situation report? Is everyone still whole? any leaks?' [HP at 5] He avoids the fire pit and walks to the other side of the room to look for anything the goblins and that fleeing Klarg left behind. investigation 23"
"I call to Dirk 'wait, the cave may not yet be empty. Let's regroup and lick our wounds before continuing the search."
Absinthe slides down the garbage chute. Athletics: 21
"'NNnnnyope! Definitely feeling leery about the room you all are standing in as it is.' I change my mind, but I'll camp closer to the bridge... probably give way and kill me anyway. Looking around anyway 6"
"Dirk looks around the bridge area and sees no traps or other hazards. Hymir comes all the way around the path and reaches the stairs to the Wolf Den at the same time that absinthe successfully makes it down the garbage chute. There lies an unconscious still bleeding Klarg. Az Emberi assumes if he simply stays to the side of the flow unlike the silly goblin, he'd be fine. Fjolnir surmises this is where everything that the goblins ever raided is here in this cave. Many crates are adorned with a symbol you haven't seen before, presumably a company or shop they belonged to. He also finds a chest with KLARG crudely written on it. Secret DM roll: 17"
I join Fjolnir in looking through Klargs loot.
stabilize him and hold him down Absinthe! DIRK GET OVER HERE AND HELP US QUESTION THIS MOTHER ****ER! I run over and try to stabilize him Medicine 5
"'Ugh... yea, let's squeeze him.' 13 To try and stabilize him."
With My 50 feet of hemp rope Absinthe ties up Klarg in a reverse hog tie with an extra noose around his neck so we can choke him for information.
Fjolnir continues pouring through the cache of ill gotten goods. 'Anything remotely useful to us immediately like bandages or a bottle of well aged spirits?' He opens the crudely autographed Klarg box- Perception: 14
"Dirk's stealth check: 15 Secret DM check: 3 You creep across the bridge to the next bend without issue. Fjolnir sneaks ahead a few feet and, looking down the cramped tunnel, sees the ass end of a goblin sticking out of the room. Against the far wall, shadows flicker like the familiar dance of campfire light trying to get to the wall, but impeded by humanoids. You can't tell how many by the conversation, but there's at least... Fjolnir stumbles out into the middle of the hallway as the wall he was leaning on crumbled just enough to warrant... stumbling out into the hallway. The stones falling was loud. Conversation stopping loud. The goblin you see leans back and sees you, bow in hand, standing in the middle of the tunnel. He yells something in goblin. 19 7 ROLL INITIATIVE!!!!! 20- Hymir 19- Gobbos 17- Az Emberi 17- Dirk 16- Fjolnir 13- Absinthe 7- ????"

"More conversation from before we got ready to attack. Grinning 'I meant no offense. Well I meant little offense. If we survive this 'eating cave' and make it to Phandalever, the first round of drinks is on me. Then maybe I'll explain from the view of the natural world all you human-oids are more alike than you realize.' Also I say we kill him and take his head with him. I believe smashface had an interest in it. They may not believe we killed him. Maybe we should have proof."
I'll hold you to that only read if you speak Sylvan Maybe we can talk about a few things I would like to hear about your animal past and maybe I can tell you about my Wizard.
"PAST- 'I really have no stake in this, do as you all like with Klarg.'  Now-ish- 17"
"I run behind Fjolnir and reach into my pocket to throw my first stone that has light cast on it at the goblin I see, then if another goblin is visible I throw the stone that us already in my other hand at the new goblin if there is no new target I throw it at the first and if the first and only target dies I only throw the one Attack 25 Potential Damage 6 3 Second attack 23 potential damage 8"
"Hymir hears the goblin scream and while it is making rude gestures at Fjolnir you whip the rock down the tunnel like you were skipping a stone on a lake. not a man of much strength, you more rely on the angle and flick of your wrist to give it the needed force (with perhaps, a little bit of magic) and it finds it's way into the goblin's eye-hole, embedding itself there and dropping it dead. It timbers backward, exuding purple light into the cavern from its face. You hear a few more screams, some terror, some anger, one that might be yelling orders, and within two or three seconds, all the light is doused, including the campfires. Given your magical expertise, you assume one of them covered the light with something. (You still have your second stone though) Everyone else is up, in the order of Az Emberi, Dirk, Fjolnir then Absinthe, in case someone makes more light or removes the cover before Absinthe takes his turn."
"Fjolnir pauses... looks over to Hymir- 'We're never playing darts.'- and he nocks the arrow and steps forward a few paces and backs against the cave wall... and tries to listen to the sounds of the room to get a picture of the number of aggressive voices... Perception: 6 'Well-ats onna you swabbies down with a shit sense of humor, feel like talking yet?!!'"

"Az Emberi shifts to his half-wolfish form and runs past the group to the dead goblin, in order to uncover the source of light for his less able-visioned companions, and comes face to face with 4 goblins lined up like a firing squad. In the instant he rounds the corner, he breathes deep as a reaction, and time slows down. This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins. He spins back to the cover of the wall, just as four arrows simultaneously hit the wall behind him, cracking small stones off, about head height. Had his reflexes been slower, had his perception not been as keen, those goblins would've made a pincushion out of him. He exhales. 'Four against the back wall, one up top, Sildar too,' He sniffs again, 'Still alive.' The cave is bathed in a purple light."
I move forward at my full distance and take cover along the northern wall.... well... maybe closer to that east facing wall.
"He jogs and skids just to the edge, just enough to sight the third goblin... Draws and looses and arrow at it. Attack: 19 . Dmg pot: 5"
"Absinthe can't get to melee range from where he is, he moves as far forward as possible keeping close to the right side wall. 'Next cave we enter better have wall scones.'"
"'Insults? Defiance? Fine!' Yeemik sees Hymir advancing, and as soon as the darts are fired from his hand, 'He dies!' and he kicks the bound Sildar in the back, forcing him over the ledge, onto the ground 10 feet below. 3 Bludgeoning. Sildar lies unconscious. (Never rolled his initiative) 15 The darts hit Yeemik all at once, and he staggered but he's still standing.

Looking at Az Emberi 'Aw.... he's so cute when he's napping!'

"I approach the remaining unconscious goblin, loot him just in case.... tilt his head back opening his mouth. I drop trou and proceed to shit in it's mouth... whilst playing a tune on my lute. Keeping a deadly serious face 'I call this one, Holy Diver.' Sure to pause, wipe with the goblin or it's clothes, pull my pants up and continue the song bestowing bardic inspiration upon Fjolnir."
"Az Emberi heals Sildar, who wakes in time to see him smash a goblin skull, splashing brain matter and other viscera on his face, temporarily sating his bloodlust. He watches in continual awe as Fjolnier severs a finger from the goblin that made rude gestures at him, and Dirk uses a sleeping goblin's head as a toilet. 'What the... I was going to say it's good to see you all again, but I could've done without seeing all of that. Would someone be so kind as to untie me?' Sildar has a kindly demeanor and looks to be in his 50's. His hands are currently tied behind his back. Well, there's four of you, where's the big fella... Absinthe was it? A spattering of blood covers Sildar from (See what Absinthe did to Yeemik below!) There he is... oh I hope Gundren didn't make a mistake hiring you... After he says this, the goblin chokes itself awake and vomits shit vomit all over the floor. Hymir, you can act before the goblin does, what are you doing?"
I walk up to the goblin stand next to him and say 'good night' and throw my last stone point blank at his face Attack 20 Adv 23 Damage 9
"The goblin goes back to sleep... for good. Congrats! You all gain 275 XP for clearing out Cragmaw Hideout! You are all LEVEL 2 and can start picking level 2 shit. At this point in time if any of you want to edit your ability scores to help maximize your characters, you may do so. Most of you are already doing the max attack bonus and damage for a level one character, but if you want to swap out to get more Dex for AC, or CON for HP, or anything for anything, go ahead. I assume you're going to loot the rest of the goblins, because that's just what you do. Along with the standard equipment for each of the 6 goblins in here, (1 shortbow, 1 Shield, 1 Scimitar) Yeemik has a pouch with 3 gold teeth (1 gp each), and 15 sp. I will add that to party loot. I will also split it up evenly so we can skip the IC requirement of selling items that are only worth money, and just add it to the pool. No need to waste time trying to find buyers for mundane items, we'll just pretend they get sold as soon as you reach town. If the consensus is to do that with the weapons you've acquired as well, I'll roll all the weapons into gold, too. Sildar, however, takes one scimitar and shield, since all his gear was taken from him. Throughout the cave you have also found: 44 arrows"
Changing back to human I stumble a little and use my shillelagh for balance. 'Changing twice in a day is exhausting.We have work to do. Two of us should go get the cart and bring it back the rest should start bringing the supplies from klargs cave to the mouth if the cave so we can loa it up and bring it back to town. Sildar can tell us what he knows of Gundrens fate while we work.'
I vote we do what you suggested but keep 1 spare set 1 sword 1 bow and 1 shield in the cart just in case
"Fjolnir starts picking up supplies and walking them to the mouth of the center of the room for export. 'Well, glad you made it through the ordeal, Sildar!'"
I wait until Sildar answers Fjolnir '...And next time you ponder whether it was a good idea for Gundren to hire us keep in mind that HE was in fact the one that hired us and we had no obligation to save you. Wizard Roll 3 13

Fjolnir aims at one of the bandit's eyes and is only off a hair, slashing the side of their face from front to back. Angered, the one bandit rushes Fjolnir and makes two shortsword attacks. Jimmy yells 'It's on boys! Get 'em!' and the other two Redbrands rush in too, one at Az Emberi and one at Dirk.

It breaks under his weight, and he and the bridge fall into the crevasse. the bridge breaks your fall however, and you take 8 bludgeoning damage and are prone. However, Hymir casts feather fall and Dirk gently lands on his feet 20' down. The bottom of the crevasse is difficult terrain. The temperature down here is unnaturally cold, and you see some things that were not visible from the top: (Dirk only) Under the North bridge is a battered wooden chest and a half eaten corpse that looks fairly fresh. You notice the rubble that makes this difficult terrain is actually piles of broken and gnawed on bones. Absinthe moves forward and shakes his fist vigorously at the thing he now sees: Oh the terror! You all 'hear' hideous laughter. and then, 'That is exactly what it will be, clumsy snake! I will let you walk away, if I get flesh to eat.'

"Az Emberi's bonfire burns the nothic's ass, and it howls a little. Fjolnir leaps over the chasm with the broken bridge below and readies an arrow in case it peeks out from behind the pillar. Hymir flings a firebolt but the nothic sees it coming a mile away and dodges. Dirk struggles through the piles of bones while singing a tune to inspire Absinthe and just manages to get under the North bridge with a dash action. He carefully opens the chest but has no time to grab anything out of it yet. Dirk: Inside the chest are 2 healing potions, a pile of silver and a pile of gold, 5 malachite gems, a scroll and a longsword in a silver-chased scabbard. The sword is inscribed with the name “Talon,” and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. (You don't have time to count it or appraise or identify anything right now, but you can take something next turn) Absinthe happily bounds across the North bridge, much to the confusion of the nothic, and succeeds in grappling it in a bearhug being inspired by Dirks wonderful song. Hymir: 'You can't figure out that little spider? It's so simple! Ha hahahahahaha!' The nothic growls angrily into your minds. 'You had a chance to leave. Now you will be my meal! No, stay away from there! Those are mine!' It attempts to writhe away from Absinthe's grasp knowing that Dirk is heading towards its treasure. 13 Hymir had seen this play out in a vision... but at the time he knew not what this creature was that Absinthe cradled and kissed and whispered sweet nothings to while it struggled. Now it makes sense, and Absinthe is able to keep a strong hold on the nothic. The creature can't get away from the bonfire and takes another 4 fire damage. Absinthe: 12 Just barely slipping out of the goliath's grasp, it runs to the edge of the cliff and starts to clamber down, making it halfway (10 feet). It looks at Dirk rifling through its things and hisses.  Initiative: 19-Dirk 13-Absinthe 11-Nothic- Taken 5 damage 5-Az Emberi 4-Fjolnir 3-Hymir Az Emberi, Fjolnir, Hymir, you're up!"

I move just north of the creature. Cast shillelagh as ba Smash it in its big stupid eye 20 dmg 10
As I hold my tight embrace on the thing. I chomp down on it's neck and try to take the biggest chunk out of it that I can. Bite: Attack: 18 Damage: 6 I spin around and hold it over the edge of the cliff so everyone can see it and if it gets free it falls.
"I do the other part of what I couldn't do in my last post. 'Be still child, this will be over soon.' I whisper, then I bite the other side of it's neck, looking for another giant chunk of flesh to relieve it of. Bite Attack: 9 Damage: 6"
"Going back in time, it turns out Absinthe had bitten its neck before. The nothic's hide being thicker than it looked, he was not able to bite off as large a chunk as he'd intended, though some damage was done. Az Emberi carefully traverses the bridge that the struggle is happening on and whacks the nothic with his magical stick for a decent effect. Fjolnir gets tired of waiting and moves around the natural column to fire an arrow at it. He misses... again. Hymir whispers an incantation and a skeletal hand grasps the nothic on its shoulder, turning some flesh to rot. Dirk spends his time looting the chest below, and Absinthe tries for a bite on the other side of the neck, but can't find purchase with his teeth. You all hear whispers and cackling as the creature claws with both hands at Absinthe while it is held over the edge of the bridge. Attack: 11 Damage: 6 Attack: 5 Damage: 8 Both attacks miss, it can't seem to get around the grapple to find flesh Initiative: 19-Dirk 13-Absinthe 11-Nothic- Taken 28 damage, Appears hurt 5-Az Emberi 4-Fjolnir 3-Hymir Az Emberi, Fjolnir, Hymir, you're up!"

Hymir's chilling grasping skeleton hand rots away more shoulder tissue. Dirk climbs out of the pit, and Absinthe brings death closer with a knee to the ribs. The nothic screeches in Absinthe's face in desperation. Battered and beaten, a chunk out of its neck and a rotting shoulder, it claws at Absinthe 2 more times. Attack: 5 Damage: 8 Attack: 11 Damage: 6 You all hear a loud, frustrated scream in your heads as it channels Fjolnir's luck.

"With the creature starting to look in rough shape, I continue to squeeze the breath out of it, constricting tighter still as it screams in my mind. Absinthe attempts to silence it's face with a headbutt. Headbutt Attack: 11 Damage: 5"
"The monster, flailing furiously, manages to dodge everything thrown at it except the chilling grip of a skeletal hand, which makes the necrotic rot start to creep into its chest. It is weak, very weak, but still fighting. It claws in further desperation at the goliath, screaming into your heads, 'We could've had a deal. I could've worked for you!'

"Fjolnir connects with an arrow, and thinks for a second that it might be time to put faith in a god. The Bugbear doesn't get away from the flames, but its attempts to do so let it dodge a fire bolt and a yklwa strike. Dirk snaps into gear and hits it on the noggin with a boomerang. The bugbear yells, 'What is this!? Redbrands trying to take out Cragmaw? No, you're traitors!' It takes a swing at Absinthe with its morningstar. Attack: 21 Damage: 12 Then runs back into the room out of the flames. The other two bugbears, including Patchy McEye, each move over and throw a javelin through the doorway at Az Emberi and move back into the East side of the room.

Sylvan I think we need some magic stones if you get a chance try and pass me 1 or 2 I ready another firebolt to any enemy that peeks out to attack As I see Absinthe go to jump over the flames I realize the dream I had of a giant jumping through an explosion to bash a monster in the face was this moment and it was glorious I give Absinthe my 13 roll on his saving throw
'Ouchies!' I exclaim in a manly voice. Shrug damage: 8 Absinthe leaps over the fire with magical grace. 'Your most glorious battles are less epic than my greatest bowel moments!

"It was happening again, Hymir had seen this play out before in a vision. Absinthe leaped over the flames with ease, and his battle cry could be heard from within. While Hymir readied another firebolt, Absinthe made a wide arc through the room and got around behind Patchy against the South wall. With deft precision, he stabbed the bugbear in his good eye, who howled, then moved the patch over the now bleeding socket. The first bugbear who was out in the hallway laughed and said, 'Ha, gave you a reason to wear that stupid thing now, eh Mosk?' To which Absinthe replied with a backhand to the nose that slammed his head against the wall. 'Focus you flea-ridden fart-bag! We have to put an end to these traitors.' 19- Dirk 13- Bugbears 1) Against East wall. Taken 23 damage, Looks rough 2) Against North wall. Unhurt 3) Mosk, in middle of them.

"Hymir makes his way past Dirk and Fjolnir to fling a firebolt through the doorway, that goes wide and scorches the ground. Absinthe steps forward to grasp the bony thing, 18 but it is surprisingly quick and dodges the attack, but still not quick enough to escape him smashing his knee into its ribcage, shattering an entire side of ribs, and having much more of an impact than he expected.

Only the front right one ducks under the table in time. They all start to glow in a fabulous pink light, like a beacon saying, 'Hit me!' A firebolt chars and finishes off the front left one. An arrow flies from the doorway and sticks through the chest of the front right one, staggering him, and Fjolnir exits the fatal funnel. A giant man charges and stomps past the table and hits the front right one with his blade, which proves trusty. He crumples to the ground.

"Fjolnir's eyes perk at the sight of a tapped cask of ale. 'Oh, thanks fellas!' he jovially kicks one of the bandits, 'Mighty fine of ya to share.' He cranes his head under the tap and drafts several mouthfulls. 'Lets poke through this next room, eh?' Stealth 18"

Stealth to help raise the **** out of the average: 16
"You open the door across the hall. This room appears to be a wizard’s workshop. A rat scurries across the floor and takes refuge under a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes."
I investigate everything looking for scrolls and spell books 13
"I search the room for valuables, try to figure out what's in the stew."
"Fjolnir investigates the rat. Investigation: 19 'Everything is suspect, damn wizards...' He looks at Hymir... 'Er... present company excluded of course...'"
I cast speak to animals as a ritual. I ask it any good stuff in here?
"'Unless I can make alcohol with anything in this room, I have no further interest in this cave let's get out of here before someone else comes.'"
"The rat seems as curious of you as you are it. It also looks hungry and appears to be begging for food. The books and notes scattered around the room are basic texts on alchemy. Among the books is a tome written in Dwarvish. Dirk can see that Iarno’s apparatus appears to be set up to brew potions of invisibility. Most of the materials in this room have no value, but three small bottles hold rare reagents: mercury, dragon bile, and powdered nightshade. These are worth 25 gp each to an apothecary or alchemist. The rat does hang around curiously watching Az Emberi casting the ritual. It doesn't respond to his rat-like squeaks, just continues to stare curiously and wait for food. Absinthe doesn't think he can make alcohol with anything in this room."
"Guys, how long does a potion of invisibility last? I close and block the southern door. 19 Trying to get a sense if we are alone, listening and looking for disturbances in the room."
Perception 7 To rat 'Is anyone invisible in this room?'
"'It doesn't understand? Oi, rat, if you don't understand squeak, how about common...? Roll over and get some of my days ration?'"
While Az Emberi is casting his ritual I ritual cast detect magic
"Maybe it's nothing, but would you block the other door Absinthe? 10 to investigate my surroundings further, see if there are signs of any recent activity or foot prints."
I stand in front of the doorway taking up as much space as possible.
"Dirk doesn't notice any signs of anyone else present. The rat all but ignores Az Emberi. You get the feeling it doesn't understand you... Hymir's detect magic ritual reveals an aura of magic surrounding the rat. Conjuration, perhaps? The room has well trodden paths that aren't dusty or dirty, but you can't tell how recent. Absinthe becomes a door."
After my detect magic I investigate again if I can 16
"Again, it's probably nothing... but I don't like it. I try to grab the rat, and take it into custody, offering it food I we foraged. 13"
Arcana 4
Az Emberi: This stubborn rat is ignoring you! Dirk: 17 The rat gets away and runs under a bookshelf.

Absinthe's already planned knee strike misses, since he had planned on having the wolf by the balls. Just as Absinthe rears back from the snarling wolf, it is engulfed in flames from Hymir's Burning Hands. Dex saves for wolves 2, 3, 4: 10 14 17 And dies in immolated agony. The other two wolves manage to escape the brunt of it, and continue chomping on Az Emberi in a display of dominance.

"The arrow strikes the wolf in the face, killing it dead. Fjolnir is up, one wolf remains, it is adjacent to Az Emberi and Hymir."
"'Get off 'em, ya damn oversized rats!' Fjolnir stands, and looses one lonely arrow at the remaining wolf. Attack: 19 dmg: 3"
"Fjolnir's arrow hits but careens off the wolf, leaving a gash but not embedding itself. Absinthe stomps around behind the wolf and exclaims, 'One of you is getting kicked in the balls today, dammit!' and proceeds to use his ki energy for a flurry of kicks to the wolf's nethers. Attack: 13 Damage: 3 Attack: 23 Damage: 5 Attack: 13 Damage: 5 'Yipe! Yipe! Yipe!' The wolf cries as each kick lands directly between it's hind legs in a 3-hit combo, the last one sending it end over end into the air and landing on it's neck with a crack, exploded nut-sac exposed to the elements. Combat is over."

The two buildings to the North are in view now. These ruined, side-by-side cottages look as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or well-off farmers in their time.

"As Krodmad is digging through pockets with his magical hand, Hymir starts talking about burning the corpses because they might be zombies. Fjolnir shoots one right through one eye as target practice, and a puff of dust rises from the corpse as its head is jolted by the blow. The corpses start groaning and slowly ambling to their feet. You've stirred up zombies! The brown circles are tables and the brown line is the bar. The bar will take an acrobatics check of 12 to successfully jump over. If you fail the check, you land prone on the opposite side, needing to use half of your movement to stand up (Not that there's a lot of need for movement in here, but whatever). The only way to not have to do this is by going through the open portion against the North wall, where the zombie is guarding. The tables are crumbled and count as difficult terrain. There's a zombie under one of the tables. 21- Az Emberi 17- Dirk 16- Zombies 9- Hymir & Krodmad 8- Absinthe & Fjolnir"

The one behind the bar swings an arm at Dirk: Attack: 4 Damage: 3 The one in the top right corner moves toward Krodmad and clumsily swings: Attack: 4 Damage: 4 Both of them horribly miss.

Fjolnir, you can keep your turn the same if you'd like, but you would now have disadvantage on each of those attacks due to a zombie being within 5ft of you. You also have the option of moving backwards out the door to be in position to hit them both, but the one in melee would get an attack of opportunity on you, and the other would have partial cover from the doorway, which would grant it a +2 AC.

"Hymir hacks up a lung, tries to duck out of the way of a couple zombie flails, Attack: 21 Damage: 6 Attack: 23 Damage: 6 , taking 12 total damage, and falters in an attack on the NE zombie, sending the bolt harmlessly into the wall. But at least he catches his breath once he's clear of the ash cloud, ready to make his next round better. Krodmad ducks out of the way of the ash puff, which is easy because he's so low to the ground. Then he clambers over the bar which is a little taller than he is, and lands flat on the ground behind it. But he still manages to shoot a zombie in the face point blank. 4 The arrow goes through its skull and it slumps to the ground, any un-life it had now gone. Fjolnir Backs away out through the door since the zombie next to him was busy with slapping Hymir, and fires an arrow at both zombies there. Both arrows hit! Puffs of ash rise off of each one, and Az Emberi and Krodmad must now make a CON save, DC 10 , or suffer the Ash Puff ! Krodmad ducks under the effects of the ash cloud again, holding his breath until it settles. Absinthe takes Fjolnir's place in the room and swings with his not so trusty yklwa, and the zombie doesn't notice.

"Zombie Dex save: 17 The zombie stumbles to the side at just the right moment to be out of Az Emberi's flames, but he still doesn't get an attack at the tactically retreating wolf-person, since he smacked Hymir so good. Unfortunately, Az does not escape the ashes, they get in his lungs enough to... not really do much this turn, but he is coughing. Fjolnir does get healed a little better than the last time, though. (I took care of it on your sheet for you) Dirk is winning! He fires a crossbow through the door, over the bar and into the zombie's chest that Fjolnir shot at to start this whole shindig. He also manages to stop coughing. It is a good day for Dirk. Taking an arrow in the chest and one in the eye from earlier doesn't stop zombie #2 from getting around the bar and lobbing a wild arm at Krodmad. Attack: 22 Damage: 2 Zombie #3 steps away from the bonfire Az Emberi threw at it, and swings at Absinthe.

(From now on I am not going to ask for so many people to take their turn at once. Please wait until I ask you to post a turn. The IC thread is getting confusing for me to keep track of, and I'd like to try to keep it flowing in a better order. Also, sometimes positions change between turns, and in tight quarters like this you may not be able to even do what you posted by the time your turn actually comes around. For example, Absinthe wanted to do something that wasn't possible at the time and had to change it. Hymir can't see a zombie without moving to a better spot right now, but he was going off the position they were in before their turn came up. Fjolnir was confused at the turn order I think, because so much was going on at once. It will be easier for everyone, I think, to be more organized. I want everyone to have fun and I know I am enjoying this, but this combat in particular has me wanting a bit more organization and simpler flow. I do hope if anyone has any issues with what I'm doing, or how I handle things, that they come to me. In general, of course. I don't want anyone to leave this group over something without seeing if we can first come up with a solution.)"
"Bonus action Disengage, and hop back over the bar again! 12 (and if for some reason I have disadvantage 9 ) Krodmad tries to leap over the bar again to get away from the zombie next to him, and scrambles to the northeastern corner of the building when he can. He turns and takes a shot at the northernmost zombie by the bar. Attack 8 Damage 7"
"Hymir, a spell sniper, moves north a bit and regardless of the fact that he can only see a portion of the zombie, pelts it in the face with a fire bolt, charring the rotten flesh off its face, down to the bare skull. It smells horrible, and looks pretty bad too, but it's still ambling around. Krodmad uses his rogueish training to escape the clutches of any zombies, and learning from his previous face-plant, gets over the bar no problem. He ends up in the corner and fires... 20 Hitting the zombie squarely. The light in its eyes fade and it slumps... then rises again still hanging on to whatever magic is keeping it on its feet.

"You all look around the inside and outside of the building for treasure, anything out of the ordinary, or hostile creatures. Expecting to see Twig blights hiding in the trees and brush inside the ruin, instead, they come from around the East side. No one is surprised by this, the creatures weren't very stealthy like they were last time, but nonetheless, they are making hungry tree noises.

Absinthe let's out a groan of relief as he finishes scratching that magical spot between the ballsack and the taint. Moves to the north corner of the building and attempts to chip away at the nearest zombie/sprig/monster thing. Yklwa Attack: 11 Damage: 6 Upper cut Attack: 8 Damage: 3

I examine the hole in the south wall
After Az Emberi examines the hole if nothing noteworthy comes from it I lead the party into the fore mentioned door in the south side of the next building
"The entrance and interior of the building do not seem trapped nor does anything seem out of place inside. Hymir enters, Az Emberi and the rest of the crew following. This building seems much like the old bar you were in with a dividing wall and doorway separating the two halves of it but in a more ruined state. As soon as Hymir gets about 10' in, he and Az notice movement against the North wall, albeit too late. Previously unseen, perfectly still and camouflaged in the shadows, a giant spider leaps down, dropping a humanoid shaped cocoon, and sprays sticky webbing at Hymir. Another one crawls over the dividing wall and shoots webbing at Az Emberi. They rear up and hiss, ready to eat their prey.  Web attack vs Hymir: 10 Miss! Web attack vs Az Emberi: 14 Miss!

"The old smithy and the zombies within offer no treasure, the only things here are old rusted tools and a couple anvils. There is no door to the next building. This ruined shop is cluttered with sagging storage shelves and broken furniture. Shards of glass and pieces of pottery glint in the weeds and rubble next to rotted books and casks. You think this is Mirna's old family shop where she told you too look for the heirloom. Sure enough, when you look under the storage shelves, you find a hidden compartment with a small wooden box in it. The box is rotted and useless, but inside is a gold necklace with an emerald pendant."
"Collect the shit out of that necklace, move on if there is nothing else of value here."
"Fjolnir collects an arrow that still is sound. 'Looks like three more buildings here on the south side of town... that are devoid of spiders and zombies!' he says, in an attempt to will the universe in his favor."

We were all mistaken believing this dragon would ever fight alongside us. Instead we are to serve beneath it and die for its amusement. Do you still feel as passionately for this dragon as you do for all dragons? If not, we all still have a chance to survive this day.'"
Cast Faerie fire on the cultists.
"'This coddling has got to come to a close.' Fjolnir steps out across the threshold into the sunlight with two arrows in hand, sights the 1st and 3rd cultist, and whispers a Hail of Thorns conjuration.

Then he pauses for Absinthe's limp-fisted taunting and looks at all his people, 'None of us have children.'

Absinthe politely moves past him to eviscerate the poor old soldier. He's only trying to get up and eat your face. He goes into the neck quite a ways, but doesn't sever it like he wanted to. Once all the zombies amble out of their bunks, they shamble to their targets. The two in the North room easily make it to Absinthe and swing club-like fists.

The light goes out in his eyes as he slumps to the corner by the door frame. #4's puff goes off to no effect. Az Emberi darts in to cast Ice Knife then darts back out. He hits his target with the piercing shard, and it explodes into more shards after a second. Dex Saves: 2 15 The blast was forced out of the chest of the one hit by the shard, into the other zombie in the room. #3 puffs his puff all by himself. Hymir lobs a flask of oil which breaks apart on the zombie in the fire. Dirk tries to convince a zombie that it's real people, but the life left this thing long ago, and the soulless husk of a body that stands before him is unresponsive. So he shoots it with his crossbow. (Carl is the one in the fire now, because the one that hit you was dead before your turn came up) Absinthe says, 'Give me! That!

So Az Emberi throws a rock at it, 6 and the magic holding the corpse to animation is dispelled, through blunt force trauma. Hymir starts a fire on the dead undead, just to be sure.

Ritual cast detect magic then search the barracks for anything of note Perception 4 Investigate 10 it has been a long day perhaps we should rest then decide wether we will confront the dragon or head to the castle
"Fjolnir backs up, trying to keep the room in view. Krodmad joins him, 'It worked on the zombies, let's try it again.' Hymir starts to cast a ritual Comprehend Languages spell while a mage hand is on his shoulder. Absinthe joins Dirk and Az Emberi in the North hallway, lumbering silently behind them. Dirk slowly opens the curtain... ...and sees only the grinning face of a hobgoblin, inches from his nose. 'Welcome to Cragmaw, ****wit!' Az Emberi lights a fire under his ass. Dex Save: 19 He jumps back behind the curtain, which quickly catches fire. (Since the Hobgoblin rolled really well on perception, he knew you were coming, but rolled so poorly on stealth, he failed to hide, so no surprise round, we're just going to regular combat.) Initiative: Hobgoblin: 21 Absinthe: 22 Az Emberi: 7 Dirk: 5 Fjolnir: 9 Hymir: 17 Krodmad: 6 Absinthe Hobgoblin Hymir Fjolnir Az Emberi Krodmad Dirk No new map yet, you haven't seen past the curtain into the room since the hobgoblin was blocking the way, and the other door is still closed. Absinthe has no sight on an enemy because he jumped back to get out of the way, and has to move past two allies to get in the fray. The curtain is on fire, and the hobgoblin is right behind it, impeding regular movement through it."
"Absinthe, frustrated at his lack of melee combatants, gets into the corner of the hallway and readies a grapple action. 'Draw him into the hall so I can give him some love.' He kisses his biceps. The Hobgoblin attempts to stay out of the bonfire: 5 He fails and takes 2 fire damage. The flaming curtain swooshes to the side as the flat of a longsword opens it. You immediately see into the room, a stone brazier full of coals glows in the middle of this small barracks. Four straw pallets are lined up along the east wall. The wall to the south has collapsed, but a barred wooden door in that direction is still clear. The hobgoblin Strikes at Dirk with his sword on the backswing from opening the curtain. Attack: 19 Damage: 5 Then backs away from the door. (I will mark the damage on your sheet.) Dirk attacks opportunely with his rapier Attack: 7 Damage: 5 but the fire makes it difficult to land a hit. The armor-clad warrior backs up a few paces and yells something in Goblin. A second hobgoblin runs South from the NW corner, shoots at Dirk with a longbow, Attack: 7 Damage: 6 But the fire obscures his vision, as well. Then he lifts the bar on the South door, pounds on it twice and moves away from it. A loud roar is heard from inside, of a beast you are not familiar with.  Unknown thing's initiative: 11 Absinthe Hobgoblin 1) Taken 2 damage Hobgoblin 2) Hymir ????? Fjolnir Az Emberi Krodmad Dirk Hymir is up! Be aware you have only heard what has happened thus far, not seen it. You will have to open the door or go around into the hall to see what is going on."
"I go S,S,E,E and open the door after seeing the 2 hobgoblins I cast Maximilians earthen grasp on the shared space north of 1 and west of the other and have it reach for the 1st one that is damaged Strength saving throw safe if he beats a 13 on failed Damage 7 and is restrained If it fails I yell Catch it on fire"
"The Hobgoblin tries to resist the earthen hand that broke through the ground. 7 It fails, and is crushed by the hand, unable to move for now. Blood trickles out of his mouth. The South door bursts off its hinges in splinters that shower the room. A large beast squeezes through the door and nearly fills the tower. It roars loudly again. You've heard of these before but never seen one. Notoriously dangerous monstrosities, its reputation for aggression proceeds it. Seeing the mix of two creatures into one, this is most obviously an owlbear.  The curious bear/owl mix when it roars is chilling, like something that shouldn't be. It faces away from the fire, primal instinct most likely, and eyes everyone through the West door.  Absinthe Hobgoblin 1) Taken 9 damage looks rough. Hobgoblin 2) Hymir Owlbear Fjolnir Az Emberi Krodmad Dirk are up!"
"Fjolnir dashes forward, grumbling with a solid '****!' with each drop of a boot- Kicks the door open and drops to a knee with his bow canted to loose arrows from the doorjamb- he whispers a Hunters Mark onto the arrow and looses: Bonus Action: @1 Hunters' Mark Dmg: 3 @1 Att: 15 Dmg: 3 @OB Att: 19 Dmg: 6 (Hordebreaker)"
I recast bonfire under the one held by the hand. Ba magic stones.
You look like you need an extra hole in you. Attack: 14 Damage: 5 Crossbow attack on Hobgoblin 1 5 advantage roll if it matters.
"Fjolnir Takes his classic hordebreaker approach, even around the owlbear he can see the hobgoblins. The one being held by the earthen fist is easier to hit, (Advantage roll: 7 ) but the arrow still clangs off his armor. The second arrow finds purchase under the other one's arm as he howls in pain. Az Emberi moves the bonfire to the one held fast and unable to move out of the way very well. 10 and it BURNS! 2 TO DEATH! He then makes some stones magical. Krodmad does not want to get closer to the owlbear, unlike Fjolnir, and shoots at it from a safe distance, without trying to get close and angle a shot at them. Since it is squeezed into a tighter space it can't move as well, and Krodmad is able to attack with advantage. Attack: 15 Damage: 12 A solid hit, right in the shoulder! Dirk did not make an extra hole in the hobgoblin, and the creature looked down at his dead comrade and drew an arrow in his bow. Absinthe is up! Hobgoblin Taken 6 damage looks hurt Hymir Owlbear Taken 12 damage Fjolnir Az Emberi Krodmad Dirk"
"Absinthe charges in and flies into the air leaping onto the owl bear things back trying to tame it like a wild stallion. 'wooah there girl, settle down for me!' Grapple: 23"
"15 The owlbear bucks, but it has been mounted-ish. The hobgoblin, in awe of the large man that just pounced the monster, tries to regain his composure and fires an arrow at Dirk. Attack: 4 Damage: 5 but the arrow just falls on the ground. 'Raaaaaggghh!' He pulls out his shield and takes a defensive stance where he is.  Absinthe Hobgoblin Taken 6 damage looks hurt Hymir is up! Owlbear Taken 12 damage Fjolnir Az Emberi Krodmad Dirk"
Grab hobgoblin 2 strength saving throw 8
"The Hobgoblin sees the earthen hand reach for him, 16 and is able to dodge its grasp. The owlbear roars its unnatural screeching roar again. Not paying much attention to its new rider, it looks at the fire, looks at the small door frame, then looks at the wider opening to the North. It charges straight for Dirk. The wild monster bites and claws at him. (Hymir gets an attack of opportunity if he stayed by the door) Beak: Attack: 22 Damage: 11 Claws: Attack: 17 Damage: 18 Dirk falls unconscious and the ravenous thing squeezes into the hallway over his body, roaring again in Az Emberi's face. Absinthe continues to hold onto the fur of its right hindquarters. Absinthe Hobgoblin Taken 6 damage looks hurt Hymir Owlbear Taken 12 damage Fjolnir Az Emberi Krodmad Dirk are up!"

Az Emberi whacks it in the beak with his magical stick then moves away leaving himself open for the creature to swipe at him. Krodmad moves up just behind Hymir and still has a good shot at the owlbear, and since that's the best target right now, he lets one fly at it.

Hymir knows without a doubt that Dirk is dead.
We need to end this and drag Dirk to a Cleric immediately there still may be hope for him
With all his might Absinthe continues to tame the strange... Beast. In an attempt to steer it toward the hobgoblins I punch it in the other eye. PPunch to the eye Attack: 6 Damage: 7 And again Attack: 21 Damage: 3
"Absinthe, currently hanging onto the rear end of the owlbear, punches it in the 'other' eye... the brown one. He swings and has to catch himself from falling with the first attack, and misses. The second hit, however, makes the beast slightly uncomfortable. The hobgoblin fires at Fjolnir Attack: 15 Damage: 3 Absinthe Hobgoblin Taken 6 damage looks hurt Hymir is up!

You vile beasts will have much to answer for and no amount of penance will balance the wrong you have committed today Grab at the hobgoblin 7
"The hobgoblin continues trying to stay out of the earthen hand's grasp, 2 And fails in the most miserable way possible! In your mind you know he tried to dodge it, but it looked like he just jumped into the palm of it. The hand squeezes the life out of him. you hear bones snap and his form distorts. Blood pours onto the ground like he was just juiced. He screams only long enough that he had air, but that was quickly and disturbingly expelled. (Have you ever actually heard a death rattle? That, but faster and louder.) The owlbear continues its rampage through the halls. Convinced that Dirk is dead, it simply tramples over him. Dirk takes 6 damage."
"Dirk's lifeless body releases a brief, intense and foul fart when trampled. DM only Prestidigitation casted for effect. Stealth 14 A light floats off my body, rapidly vanishing."
Seeing the path ahead getting narrow I gallantly maneuver to a firm embrace. Athletics: 20 'I'm not that easy to get rid of!' 2nd Athletics: 24 3rd Athletics: 21
"Absinthe decides to continue 'yee-hawing' and gets pressed against the wall while Dirk gets trampled, taking 1 crushing damage. (It's basically bludgeoning damage, with flair.) The owlbear charges on, forcing itself through the next door with Absinthe still grasping its fur, taking 4 more damage from being pressed against the door frame. Upon seeing daylight, it turns toward the hidden entrance you all came through and barrels forward. Absinthe, stubbornly refusing to let go, takes 9 damage from being crushed against the debris on the way out. He and the owlbear are now outside the castle. (And off the map) Fjolnir, Az Emberi, Krodmad, and... well... poor Dirk. Absinthe Hobgoblin has been juiced Hymir Owlbear Taken 44 damage looks hurt Fjolnir Az Emberi Krodmad Dirk"
Shrug damage: 3 'This rodeo is getting out of hand.'
"Fjolnir whispers... 'F..for ****s sake, why can't things just go according to plan..?' he listens to hear if there is any additional movement thanks to the behemoth that just wrecked shop, and where it is coming from. Perception: 6 Creep slowly to the curtain to check on Dirk Stealth: 8"
Hearing the owlbear loudly exit north. I run back the way I came. I can't make it to dirk but I roll perception to figure out if he's ok 23 If i think he's ok I leave well enough alone. If I think he's dead or dying I cast healing word in a last ditch effort to save him 4
"Fjolnir hears nothing aside from the beast trouncing through. You look Dirk over. He is not moving, and blood is trickling out of his mouth. Az Emberi rushes back through to check on Dirk as well and sees Fjolnir there shaking his head. Az Emberi: You see a faint breath that Fjolnir must have missed. Dirk is on the edge of life, but you suspect he is still feigning death. Whether you want to oust him or keep up the ruse is up to you, but you feel that Dirk is doing it to **** with you.  Krodmad chases after the owlbear, and gets just North of the curtain to see it. He fires a shot even with limited visibility: Attack: 16 Damage: 10 and hits! It howls in pain. Owlbear has taken 54 damage, and looks rough. Absinthe and Hymir are up , then the owlbear again."

They are not surprised, so the surprise round will be: Dirk King Grol Absinthe Hidden thing"
Attack: 22 Damage: 4 Nope. At the hidden thing..... with a crossbow. And a little ditty to give Az an edge via Mantle of inspiration Ya crapped on my plan but I don't want you to die. La la la... lala. Also targeting Hymir and Fjolnir.
Tackle the stuffing out of the hobgoblin: 6 Followed swiftly by an elbow to the face Attack: 17 Damage: 3
"Dirk deftly fires an arrow through the barely open door, and it slices across the forearm of the unseen person pushing on it. A female voice screams out in pain. He then throws some bonus HPs around. Hymir, Az Emberi and Fjolnir feel invigorated, and Hymir comes into the room to join the fray about to happen. 'You defy King Grol?' The bugbear flings Gundren to the side and he hits the wall and tumbles to the ground in a heap. (1 automatic death save failure) The once stable dwarf is now dying. Fjolnir looses an arrow but it misses him entirely. He meets Absinthe's gaze and returns the charge, swinging his morning star like the brute he is. Attack: 20 Damage: 9 'Vyerith, time to come out and play!' He looks at the door she is hiding behind. Absinthe attempts to tackle King Grol, 19 but is thrown off balance by the hit from the larger than normal goblinoid king. He does manage to connect with his elbow, but not doing as much as he'd hoped. The door to the smaller area of the tower flies open, standing there is a drow female with no weapons. For a second, she looks like an innocent girl about to cry for being forced to fight, but she takes an aggressive stance with a stoic expression that can only come from a battle hardened individual, and proceeds to pummel Az Emberi with a series of punches. Attack: 24 Damage: 19 Attack: 25 Damage: 16 The first strike hits his rib cage and sends a painful shock-wave through his body. The second strike catches his elongated chin and drops him to the ground. Az Emberi is unconscious. The woman steps out and stands over her conquest, facing Hymir. She raises her fists and smirks.

Vyerith attack of opportunity on Hymir for invading her personal space: Attack: 18 Damage: 5 The hit would have landed but a magical force thwarts it.
"I move to just south of Hymir. I reach into Az Emberi's clothes to grab his dick. Sorry buddy this is how I heal. We're all uncomfortable here. 11 Cure wounds I whisper a sweet hymn to Absinthe about killing everything, called the Doom song. Doom doom doom DooOm DOOm dooM doOM DOOM doom DOoM. bardic inspiration."
"Az Emberi looks like he's doing really bad at trying to stay alive, so Hymir ignores all potential dangers and reaches over to drag him away from the hard hitting drow. She swings at him, but the glass staff proves deft at deflecting the blow. Dirk... Dirks, and now Az Emberi has a fighting chance. King Grol continues wailing on Absinthe.

"Fjolnir marks King Grol and hits him in the shoulder with an arrow. He winces, but stays his course. Absinthe makes use of his inner ki to pummel the goblin king with furious strikes, all meet their mark with gusto. King Grol laughs as blood trickles out of his mouth from the hits to his lungs/nipples. Krodmad loses an arrow that goes right over the wolf. Vyerith, in a silky voice says, 'You creeps are weird.' Then punches Dirk twice. Attack: 18 Damage: 6 Attack: 22 Damage: 10 With the same two punch combo that knocked Az Emberi out, she takes Dirk to the ground. He is now unconscious. She turns to Hymir.

"Az Emberi does not return Dirks favor, and thus the healing is less potent, but Dirk awakens nonetheless. Hymir throws caution to the wind since he has a magical defense staff, and runs to aid Gundren. Vyerith swings at him. Attack: 9 Damage: 5 but doesn't even trigger his magical shield. With his kit, he stabilizes the dying dwarf. Dirk swings twice, the drow ducks the shortsword, and takes a slash on her arm from the dagger. Not too deep though. She glares at Dirk and licks the blood that trickles out. King Grol grips his spiked mace with both hands, and swings sideways at Absinthe's head. He grins. 'You can't kill me, I'm the king.' Attack: 18 Damage: 13 Absinthe's head hits the wall, then the floor. He is unconscious and dying. King Grol turns around to Hymir. 'You can't have him. I'm working on selling him to the Black Spider.' He readies his morning star again. Snarl, seeing the cues from his master, bites at Hymir. Attack: 24 Damage: 14 The wolf hits a nerve in Hymir's leg, as well as a vein or two, and the bleeding wound hurts, bad. (Hymir must make a DC 11 STR save.

Arcana check on the bird 11 If the arcana check is good then I say this Hey it looks like we can just walk through that spirit to heal on any of our turns  i cast my earth fist spell on the drow DC 13 str 3 and restricted nothing on success
"Az Emberi heals himself with a magical spirit, (I added the 1 HP to your sheet) and then flies over to Dirk. Hymir says 'Hey it looks like we can just walk through that spirit to heal on any of our turns' Although, none of you thought you were taking turns, as combat seems to carry out in a completely fluid fashion, bereft of any 'turn' taking. I mean, everybody pretty much is able to make one attack every 6 seconds, with the exception of Absinthe who is relatively quick with his fists, and Fjolnir if there's two enemies close to each other, along with moving approximately 30 feet, and sometimes people just stand there, but ultimately, the concept of taking turns in battle is rather silly. This isn't Dragon Chess. Yes, you move when there's an opening, and it's tougher to get through your friends, and you attack at opportune times, but a 'turn' in combat is rather FOURTH WALL BREAKING, JAKE! Then he casts mud hand at the drow. 2 and she's stuck. Good job, you get a chimichanga.

He springs awake and goes into a monken rage, slashes King Grol across the front of his unarmored neck, and plants his knee into the bugbear's stomach... through his groin. The snapping of his old hip bones echoes through the room, and the king falls unconscious from a combination of pain and blood loss. He bleeds out on the ground. Krodmad steps into a better position and fires an arrow at Vyerith. He hits an exposed leg and she growls, which slowly turns into a scream. Her once nearly sultry voice now a high-pitched siren that nearly makes you cover your ears. She starts thrashing to get free. 6 But break free she does not. She does get an arm out and swings wildly at Az Emberi. 'Death to you all! I will not go down so easily!'

Az Emberi holds his hand in front of him palm up and conjures a small flame. He raises his hand above his head and closes his fist. Flames shoot out in the shape of a scimitar. He snarls and brings the scimita down. Eyes and teeth showing intent to kill. Atk 20 adv. 18 Dmg. 14  last second gains his wits and begrudgingly aims for non lethal.

"Az Emberi drops his healing spirit to create a blade made entirely of flame in his hand and slashes with it. It cuts and cauterizes her face, leaving a burn scar. She continues screaming and flailing. Hymir does not get to use the spirit to heal himself, as it disappears right before he steps into it. He squeezes his earthen fist to crush Vyerith. 6 who takes the full brunt of it. Dirk rests his short sword and dagger on her neck like a pair of scissors. She screams, 'The Black Spider will have your heads when I don't return!' He whacks her with the blunt of his sword instead, knocking her unconscious. Combat is over."
Fjolnir investigates the bodies for anything noteworthy: 10 'Everyone ok? We should get chains on this thing before she comes to...'
"Coming from a place of millennia of oppression at the hands of drow, Krodmad, the deep gnome, of the Underdark, fully understanding just how thoroughly evil all drow are, knows even an unconscious drow is a danger, plus that whole business with his friend Gundren, and responds appropriately.

Dirk and Fjolnir each swing two weapons at it. It jumps away from Dirk and he hits the wall with both sword and dagger. (You didn't have advantage, unless there was a reason I didn't know about?) But it ducked right into Fjolnir's swings, taking a slash from each, one on the side of the neck and one on the calf. It looks to be in really bad shape. It does manage to let out a yelp in Goblin, and you hear the unmistakable sound of swords being unsheathed in the kitchen.

As he nears Absinthe's ass, he looks into the room to see the goblin horde and centers his fog spell behind the goblin closest to the wall towards the back of the room. He then turnsabout, hopefully avoiding any goblin aggression from the goblin at the door, and comes to a stop behind Fjolnir."
"Krodmad dashes around his allies to get in and out of position to see into the large kitchen, and casts Fog Cloud, enveloping the room and heavily obscuring the vision of the goblins, and also, your vision of the goblins.

(Even if I use your attempted throw roll as your bonus unarmed attack action, you still won't hit him, unfortunately) The little goblin defiantly lives in front of you, not allowing access to the kitchen, sword and shield in hand, a fog cloud obscuring the room behind him.

He tries to keep his head gust outside the foj cloud to see two shininj pink joblins and looses two arrows. One must have hit Yejj solidly, since his barking of orders stopped instantly and his lijht dimmed slijhtly. The other arrow missed its mark. Fjolnir then hears a faint voice in his head, 'Gif,' as if someone was saying the word 'gift' but stopped before the 't.' The remaining two shiny goblins scream again once they hear their boss bite it, and run to the back of the room. Their light dims completely as they get too far away for it to pierce the clouds. Hymir is up! Round 2, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblins: -1) Shiny -2) Shiny -3) Taken 6 damage, location unknown 8-Hymir 7-Yegg- Dead!"
Krodmad stops committing his enormous intellect to the existence of the fog cloud.
"The fog dissipates as Krodmad lets his concentration down. A small passageway dug through the rubble is revealed at the west end of the room, and two of the fleeing goblins are seen through it. They both fire shortbows at Hymir as soon as the fog drops. (held action) Attack: 17 Damage: 5 Attack: 16 Damage: 4 He reacts quickly with a magical shield and the arrows are deflected. (Marked your charges for you)"
"As i'm about to yell out 'Hey can you drop this fog' it dissipates leaving the active scene of horror. Hey can you... yep yep yep. i move W,W,W to get a better look at the goblins, and as long as nothing new is revealed, since they made no effort to surrender i cast fire bolt on the one with Faerie Fire on it Hit 14 adv. 11 dmg 5 after being shot at twice i march up W one more square possibly between the rubble making sure i don't fall out the wall or some goofy shit while trying to be cool and cast burning hands again dex save 13 or half fire dmg 10 After the attack I finish my movement going West I then yell Hey there are three more in here!"
"Hymir engulfs the two goblins in fiery DOOM! the non-shiny one burns to a crisp and falls down like a crispy potato crisp. Dex save: 5 The shiny one follows suit and dies crispily. Hymir then moves forward into the small passage, exploring the next room and coming face to face with a firing squad of 3 goblins, who were warned you were coming and were holding an arrow drawn for such time as anyone came through. Their arrows fly, (At advantage, because you're in a smaller space) Attack: 14 Damage: 5 Attack: 24 Damage: 5 Attack: 16 Damage: 6 1 misses, 1 hits, and 1 would have hit but Hymir uses another shield spell. (unless you don't want to) For a total of 5 damage to Hymir.  Round 3, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblins: -1) Shiny -2) -3) -4) 8-Hymir"
Krodmad moves into the room next to the short table and uses his mage hand to open the door on the north wall.
Absinthe moves 25 feet to the open doorway.
"Absinthe peers through the door way into a hall. There are many more doors here, and the corridor is cluttered with dusty rubble and fallen plaster from a partial collapse of the ceiling overhead. (map updated) There are three more goblins around the West corner, one of them is sparkly."
Absinthe continues around the corner to the closest goblin and swings like a spider monkey. Yklwa Attack: 18 Damage: 9 Knee to the face Attack: 11 Damage: 5 Advantage 13
"As Absinthe takes a step from his location near the door, he hears a *snap* and looks down to see a tripwire has triggered. A cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones falls upon him. Roll a DEX save, DC 10. On failure, you take 13 bludgeoning damage, on success you take half. Then you make it to the goblin to yklwa his face. It sticks into his eye and kills him dead. You miss the other with your knee attack, but lift the goblin a few feet in the air and shake him off your weapon. ???? 4"
Dexterity save: 23 Shrug damage: 5
"Attack: 5 Damage: 3 On an enemy, Idc which. er um... nvm."
"'Shit, more?!' Fjolnir waddles ahead to behind Krodmad, sights three goblins to the west, and fires at the North two of the bunch. Att: 22 Dmg: 5 Att: 13 Dmg: 10 (Hordebreaker)"
I move behind hymir and chuck a rock throgh the passage at the north goblin in the group of three Atk. 6 dmg. 8
"Az Emberi and Dirk both miss spectacularly. If missing were a sport, they would've taken the cup. Fjolnir hits both of his targets, however, and the one in the center dies outright. He acted as though he was blocking with his shield, but that was strapped to his back and he caught the arrow in the chest. The two goblins on Absinthe make scimitar attacks. Attack: 13 Damage: 8 Attack: 11 Damage: 5 The two left in the South tower make another volley at Hymir Attack: 11 Damage: 4 Attack: 10 Damage: 4 With all the commotion and yelling and rubble falling from the ceiling, 2 more goblins come out of the Northwest door from Absinthe and fire arrows at him.Attack: 7 Damage: 5 Attack: 17 Damage: 5 All of them miss except for one arrow that strikes Absinthe for 5 damage.

I shoot the injured goblin in the face with a firebolt hit 20 dmg 8 I then move over to the door to check on Absinthe seeing he is injured himself I yell to the group I got this last 1 here guys and girl there are 4 more surrounding Absinthe go help him Assuming the goblin I hit is dead I move south next to the last goblin unblocking the door and blocking the goblin
"Hymir smashes the little goblin's face with a firebolt, then peeks through the door and alarms to the presence of more goblins. After that, four Hobgoblins file out of the North door of the hallway and form a small phalanx in front of the two goblins there, with longswords and shields at the ready.

Deflect missle: 6 Return to sender: 15 Damage: 4 Absinthe bellows out a frightfully loud howl that turns into a hall echoing fart. 'I will squeeze the life out of everything that steps to me! Or something like that!' At hobgoblin north of me: Yklwa Attack: 14 Damage: 10 Throat punch Attack: 21 Damage: 3 Flurry of blows Ki point: Another throat punch Attack: 20 Damage: 4 I then disengage and move south away from the enemy.
"Krodmad moves to the opposite side of Fjolnir, looks through the doorway, and unleashes the crowd favorite spell, fog cloud, between the second goblin and hobgoblin in the adjoining room."
"Krodmad casts patented chaos in the hallway, and Absinthe attempts to strike a few times at the place where he knows the Hobgoblin is. Disadvantage rolls: 12 22 He connects with only the last strike, after hitting the armor a could times and gauging where the throat is. Then he uses his drunken technique and the smokescreen to get out of melee with so many things. Az Emberi, Dirk and Fjolnir are up.

"Attack: 14 Damage: 5 19 (If disadvantaged or something) Somebody getting shot here, optimal targets preferred."
I'll crawl through the passage and do cute wounds on absinth 11
"Az Emberi cutes Absinthe's wounds to near full health. Dirk comes in behind him and fires an arrow at the bow wielding goblin in the South tower. A hit, but not a kill."
"Fjolnir eyes the goblin standing on the rubble pile, accosting Hymir, and looses an arrow past Dirk at it' Att: 26 Dmg: 6 Dmg: 5"
"An expert shot by Fjolnir. There was only a little bit of goblin peeking out from behind all the rubble, but one kill was earned. There is more yelling in goblin as it seems more chaos is happening behind the fog. The shiny pink goblin runs out of the fog, swinging its scimitar at Absinthe, then runs back into the fog. Absinthe gets an attack of opportunity at advantage because of the Faerie Fire. Then another goblin slowly creeps out of the fog, sees Absinthe and charges. Two Scimitar attacks: Attack: 23 Damage: 3 Attack: 12 Damage: 6 The shiny one hits before attempting to dart back into the cloud, while the other one misses, but stays put. The two Northern goblins do not make an appearance.

Yklwa of opportunity Attack: 22 Damage: 9
I think this fog will make them gather at the door let's funnel them in I say the spoiler in draconic Sylvan and abyssal Cast firebolt on the one I do see Hit 24 Damage 9
"Absinthe slices the last shiny one with his yklwa as it turns its back to him, cutting him down. Hymir firebolts the one that decided to stay in Absinthe's face, also dead. The hobgoblins file into the kitchen just like they did into the hallway, and start reforming their phalanx. One at a time they emerge from the fog, striking one opponent as they come out. #4 vs Fjolnir: Attack: 9 Damage: 3 #3 vs Fjolnir: Attack: 18 Damage: 3 Martial advantage: 7 #2 vs Krodmad: Attack: 10 Damage: 2 Martial advantage: 7 Fjolnir takes 10 damage from the one right in front of him, the other two miss, and 1 doesn't make it in far enough to hit anyone.

Absinthe moves north one square and opens the door to his left. Save for dodge.
Krodmad's slippery nature lets him back things up (cunning action disengage) and get the heck out of Dodge (move back to the door we came in) . He fires a shot at the hobgoblin directly in front of Fjolnir. Attack 20 Damage 9 + Sneak Attack 8
"Krodmad catches the hobgoblin in the neck and downs him in one gurgly strike. Absinthe opens the side door to an empty guard post with an arrow slit that views the front steps.

"'Ohh I hate you unwashed shits...' Fjolnir steps back along the wall with Krodmad, Whispers ' thorns ' in common across the fletching, casting Hail of Thorns. He sights Hobgoblin 1, and looses arrows at him and Hobgoblin 2, H1 vs Att: 17 Dmg: 5 H2 vs Att: 16 Dmg: 8 (Hordebreaker)"
I do nothing new. I move in south west of fjolnir and throw a stone at hobgoblin 2 It missed.
"I dunno, more shooting I guess? I move the left of Krodmad and shoot the dar right enemy. Attack: 22 Damage: 9"
"Dirk Moves along the wall and fires a bolt at a hobgoblin, hurting it pretty badly. Azemberi doesn't do anything new, upset that he's never seen a dinosaur before. Fjolnir gets out of melee with the hobgoblins, provoking attacks of opportunity from #2 and #4 Attack: 15 Damage: 9 Attack: 23 Damage: 10 Then casts hail of thorns, but the two arrows he fires both clang off their large shields, and don't trigger the spell. (The spell is still active, it will trigger on the next hit. It will become inactive if you cast another Concentration spell, get hit too hard and lose concentration, or after 1 min./10 rounds of combat) Nothing is heard or seen of the 2 goblins from the North tower.

I would like to travel up and hit #2 the space 1 north of #2 in case #3 is there and #1 and 4 with burning hands if that's not possible then just the 3 I can see 7
"Hymir gets in the small passage again and shoots off another burning hands. He catches all 3 hobgoblins in the blaze. Dex Saves: 17 21 21 They see it coming a mile away, and all put up their shields to catch the brunt of it. The fiery magic wraps around their shields and licks at their sides, and one of them goes down anyway. The table also catches fire. The two hobgoblins look at each other, nod and form up again, marching forward. #2 closes in and #1 moves around the fire on the table, Fjolnir and Az Emberi are face to face with them. #1 vs Fjolnir: Attack: 8 Damage: 9 miss! #2 vs Az Emberi: Attack: 22 Damage: 6 Hit!

Hobo #2 pew pew. Attack 21 Damage 7 Sneak Attack 8
I meant Hobo #1. I just woke up and my tired eyes have transposed them. Whichever one is in front of Fjolnir.
"Absinthe moves; N, N, N, E, E, E, S, S and swings at the hobgoblin. Yklwa Attack: 20 Damage: 7 Punch to spine Attack: 13 Damage: 5"
"Krodmad fires a deadly arrow and downs one of the last two hobgoblins. Just after that, Absinthe uses his ki for a burst of speed and maneuvers with his superior memory right into a wall where he thought the door was. With some feeling around he gets through the door, leaps out of the fog from behind the last hobgoblin and buries his yklwa in the back of his neck, taking it to the floor. The hobgoblins all lay dead in the kitchen. Az Emberi, Dirk, Fjolnir are up. Round 6, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblins: AC 15, (13 w/bow) HP 7 To the North -5) -6) at 3 HP 8-Hymir"
"After seeing the last hobgoblin fall, Krodmad releases the fog."
"'Hey guys, it's pretty crazy in there, walls are moving around and just smacking into things.'"
I cast healing spirit on my square healing for 6 then as a ba I move it to fjolnir's space so he heals. 5 at the start of his turn. I yell call out or walk through the spirit if you're hurt.'
The fog has lifted.
"I move all the way to the left, just before the door. Cast unseen servant and send it north... in a menacing fashion. I order you to fetch their souls. I use mantle of inspiration to grant Fjolnir, Absinthe and my unseen servant extra 5 hitpoints and movement, allowing my unseen servant to move 30 ft instead of just 15."
"Krodmad dropped the fog, and the two goblins that were stuck in the fog release arrows they have been holding at Absinthe. Attack: 23 Damage: 3 Attack: 15 Damage: 6 For 9 damage total. Az Emberi creates his healing spirit and heals himself, (I adjusted your HP on your sheet) and then moved the spirit to Fjolnir while telling everyone to move through the spirit on their turn if they need healing. Dirk moves in front of the door, Then he commands his unseen servant to gather the goblin's souls... so... it tries to do that, which only succeeds at making the goblins uncomfortable... But he did give it more HP and movement... along with Fjolnir and Absinthe (who can each make a move if they want as their reaction) Fjolnir heals 5 HP (I changed on your sheet) and then...(see below)"
"'Thanks fellers...' Fjolnir hurriedly hobbles 20' west, looks through the open door and down the hallway at the two goblin unwashed shit****s, and looses arrows at them, hoping to land one good one and shower the other with thorns. G1 vs Att: 11 Dmg: 5 G2 vs Att: 12 Dmg: 9 (Hordebreaker)"
"Fjolnir curses as both his arrows miss for the second time in a row. The goblins jump around frantically as SOMETHING is either tickling them, or trying to take their souls. Either way, they have a hard time concentrating on shooting at Fjolnir. Attack: 6 Damage: 5 Attack: 19 Damage: 7 Fjolnir's temporary HP boost from Dirk fades as an arrow strikes his chest, but does not pierce his armor, it just hurts. The goblins run inside the NW door from the hallway. Hymir is up.  Round 6, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblins: AC 15, (13 w/bow) HP 7 -5) -6) at 3 HP 8-Hymir"
I move into the spirit and heal 6 then I dash and move back through the passage to move into the hallway the goblins were in through the south door
"Krodmad stands to his full 5'something height, knees popping for having been crouched down for so long. He moves out the door and hooks a left, getting a couple spaces from the closed door in the hall before using mage hand to attempt opening it."
"Krodmad uses his mage hand to open the door and nothing happens. From your angle, you can see the ceiling is high and there is no natural light getting in, but that's all. Absinthe says, 'You're not getting away that easy, you little shits!' and charges toward the door the goblins disappeared through, and makes it with movement to spare. He all but rips the door off its hinges trying to open it, and pummels the one standing right behind the door with a combo attack. Attack: 6 Damage: 7 Attack: 8 Damage: 6 He misses, but it at least looks good.  Round 7, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblins: AC 15, (13 w/bow) HP 7 -5) -6) at 3 HP 8-Hymir"
I ba move my spirit to the spot in front of the door. Then move through it and out the door 1 space ready a rock for first hostile I see Heal 4
"Fjolnir recieves healing 3 , and steps forward through the door, and to the left of Az- ready's a shot for anything aggressive to rear its head in the hallway."
I move just south of Absinthe and cast lvl 2 cure wounds on him. 8 Pretty sure I walked through a heart along the way 6
"Dirk steps through the door past his allies and gives Absinthe a much-needed boost to his health. (Adjusted on his sheet) Az Emberi and Fjolnir both ready attack actions for a clear shot at the door. (I will allow you to fire at the one in the doorway, but at 3/4 cover due to the angle, so if you don't want to throw your attack, you can make it before your next turn, but his AC will be 20 for you) All three of them stepped through the healing spirit for a little wound mending. (Not adjusted on your sheets, do that one yourselves, I wasn't sure where everyone was to know if you had already done it.) The two goblins trapped in the small lookout room start to question their decision-making abilities, and looking at the size difference between themselves and Absinthe, decide not to push him out of the way, and try cutting at his legs. Attack: 15 Damage: 6 Attack: 9 Damage: 5 one of them hits for 6 damage (Noted on your sheet) Hymir is up! Round 7, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblins: AC 15, (13 w/bow) HP 7 -5) -6) at 3 HP 8-Hymir"
I move up to get an angle If I'm able to hit G6 I do if not then g5 Firebolt Hit 25 Damage 8 9
Dustfinger looms in the doorway and peers into the darkness.
"Hymir flings a fireball past Absinthe and it simply melts the goblin in the doorway. Krodmad AKA Dustfinger gets to the doorway that none of the rest of you know he's opened. Spoiler for Krodmad: This high, narrow hall looks as if it might have been part of a chapel or shrine at one time. Angelic figures are sculpted along the room’s upper reaches, looking down on the floor below. To the north, heavy curtains block a matching pair of archways. Between the archways is a cracked but ornately carved stone brazier. 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir Are all up."
I ba my spirit to fjolnir's spot so he gets 1d6 at start if his turn I move through it for 6 healing to the spot jyst south if Dirk and ready a stone for first hostile I see.
Absinthe steps through the doorway and slaps the shit out of the goblin. Yklwa Attack: 12 Damage: 8 Slap to face Attack: 6 Damage: 6
"Fjolnir recieves 5 healing from Az's Healing Spirit, holds his readied shot for anything aggressive through the doors, and looks to the cracks of the doors, or keyholes, for sign of movement, or sounds of occupation. Perception: 7"
Dustfinger uses mage hand to move the curtains aside on the archway to the left to see what's behind.
"Attack: 18 Damage: 3 shoots the thing, the goblin thing.... I see it. Why don't you tell me where it is so I can see if you know... cause I already know."
"Krodmad (since you moved but didn't perform an action last turn, I'm assuming you are adding to your previous turn) Here's your spoiler: This is what you can see with your darkvision:  Absinthe swings twice and the goblin dodges both. Az Emeberi throws his heals around and gets ready for something to peek out. Dirk hits the gobbo with a bolt and hits it in the leg. It grimaces and grinds its teeth. Fjolnir also waits for something to shoot, and looks around but doesn't see or hear anything new. The goblin looks at the bolt in its leg, looks up at Absinthe, looks at Dirk loading another bolt, and begins to cry. It slashes once more out of desperation. Attack: 11 Damage: 3 But it can't connect, probably because its vision is clouded with tears. Hymir is up! Then Krodmad may act. Round 7, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblin: AC 15, (13 w/bow) HP 4/7 8-Hymir"
I'm tired of these mother ****ing goblins in this mother ****ing castle Hit 6 Damage 9 I'm not going to do anything about it right now apparently I'm just saying
Dustfinger checks out whatever is lurking in the dark corners behind the curtains.
"Hymir makes up a catchphrase but fails to deliver on it to hilarious result. Krodmad: You begin to creep along the wall to the North to check out the curtain, and you hear a noise to your left, like a wet plop. You look over just in time to see: A Grick that is already lashing out at you with barbed tentacles: Attack: 12 Damage: 14 Luckily, you react quickly enough to get out of its way Grick initiative: 4 EVERYONE hears the sounds of a scuffle from the castles central room. Round 8, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblin: AC 15, (13 w/bow) HP 4/7 8-Hymir 4-???? Absinthe, Az Emberi, Dirk, Fjolnir, you may act!"
I hear the sound and don't see krodmad. I leave my spirit where it is. And move to the door east of me. Open it and prep a stone through for a hostile.
"I ready my crossbow and stand beside Az to see what I can see... and shoot what need be shot. I'm definitely not thinking of Krodmad. Attack: 10 Damage: 8 NOT at Krodmad, I think."
For those with Darkvision or a light source and can see into the central room:
"'Gah!' Att: 20 Dmg: 9 Rather surprised, Fjolnir releases his grip and sails an arrow at the creature. He walks several paces toward the door to gain better visual purchase on the room, trying not to crowd out the doorway. '..the hell is that?!' nocking a second arrow, drawing and loosing it at the creature. Att: 7 Dmg: 6 Heals from the healing spirit: 4"
"Dustfinger screams like a girl and backs way the heck up to the bottom corner of the room (Cunning action disengage). He tries to put that things eye out with an arrow, but doesn't know where the eyes are. Bow attack 18 Damage 3"
Throw rock 7 dmg 5
Yklwa Attack: 6 Damage: 6 Slap the bitch if he's still alive Attack: 23 Damage: 5
"Krodmad jumps back and disengages, firing an arrow when he gets back to the corner. The strike hits, but doesn't do the damage he thought it would... Absinthe bitch slaps the goblin to death... finally. Az Emberi opens the door after hearing the kerfuffle. Also freaking out at the sight of the thing, he throws a rock that doesn't hit its mark. When he opens the door, Fjolnir is also able to see the thing, and lands a surprised hit! The hit is solid, but like Krodmad's arrow, it falls out instead of sinking in too deep. This thing must have thick hide... Dirk misses, but he's really enthusiastic about it. And he wasn't aiming at Krodmad. Fjolnir fires again but drops the arrow right out of his grip instead of losing it as intended. Round 8, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 10-Goblin: DED 8-Hymir 4-Grick Taken 7 damage"
after hearing screams a goblin crying then being mudered and the rest of the part freak out i yell Alright everyone what the **** is going on everyone seems to be reacting but as someone without the same visual abilities a brief description would be super helpful. i move around to possibly see an angle or something I want to light up the room if I can pick up a rock cast light and throw it in if not I walk towards the room cast light on something in the doorway and back up from the doorway (silver light)
"You cast light on a rock and toss it in the room. The first thing you notice is a screeching creature:  And the room layout is as such right now:  The creature continues its assault on Krodmad. It lashes out its tentacles: Attack: 20 Damage: 5 And they connect! It uses the tentacles to pull Krodmad in and bite with its sharp beak. Attack: 17 Damage: 8 CHOMP! Krodmad is slashed up a bit, and is looking rough. (currently at 5 HP) Round 9, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 8-Hymir 4-Grick Taken 7 damage"
"Dustfinger disengages and flees out the door and takes a right as far as he can, quaffing his potion of healing on the way. 7"
Absinthe charges back to the group shuffles through the crowd and up to the ugly tenticale beast. 'You belong in an anime porno... Or something like that!' Yklwa Attack: 5 Damage: 10 Punch to tenticale Attack: 11 Damage: 3

Walk in the door move two spots north. Ba spirit to inside of door. Throw stone atk 9 dmg. 5
"Krodmad does indeed disengage and runs and drinks his healing potion. (I added the 7 HP heal) Absinthe closes in but can't get a fix on the slithery thing. Az Emberi moves the healing spirit to just inside the door for anyone to heal and flings a rock that hits the wall for 5 damage. Dirk gives Absinthe some healing.

"Fjolnir lays a deft strike right in the beast's side, but doesn't do as much damage as he thinks it should...

(the Grick is Restrained ) Hymir throws a mote of flame at its tangled up body. Advantage from it being restrained: 17 And hits for some burny damage. The grick struggles to lash out at Absinthe with its tentacles Attack: 19 Damage: 12 But still pulls off a hit!

Absinthe uses the beasts entanglement to his advantage and proceeds to use his remaining Ki point to go buck wild on the beast. Yklwa Attack: 24 Damage: 17 Kick to tenticale Attack: 17 Damage: 3 Kick to another tenticale Attack: 17 Damage: 3

I go look through that curtain to the north stealth 22
I cast light on my dagger and cover the light (purple) stack behind az waiting for a signal Stealth 10 Perception 21
24 Stealth and 7 perception I go to the far right curtain to peak through.
"15 9 The three of you who peeked into the doorway through the curtains: notice a stone altar standing in the middle of the room, covered with bloodstained black cloth. Golden ritual implements — a chalice, a knife, and a censer — are carefully arranged on top of the altar. There are 3 goblins hiding behind the altar. They don't seem to notice you yet (But hiding takes an action, so your stealth rolls indicate you've already acted this round) Round 10, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 9-More Goblins 8-Hymir  Fjolnir can still act."
"Fjolnir moonwalks through the healing spirit 6 , takes a stance behind Dirk, and readies an arrow for anything remotely goblinlike."
"Krodmad and Absinthe are up, but neither of you know what everyone else is lining up at the curtains for. They appear to be hiding. Round 11, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe"
Dustfinger takes a dip in the healing spirit of love. 6
"Absinthe moves toward the group that is peaking through the curtains like a bunch of perverts. 'Well that was a good fight, what's next?'"
All that happens 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir are up!
Move into room and just out of doorway. Attack: 10 Damage: 7 on a far right foe.
"Dirk enters the room and shoots wide, alerting the three goblins within of his presence! They are all adorned in dirty, torn and blood-stained ceremonial robes. The one in the center yells in common, 'Slay the heathens! Maglubiyet wants them dead!' They all release held arrows at him. Attack: 8 Damage: 8 Attack: 12 Damage: 8 Attack: 18 Damage: 3 One arrow strikes him, the other two miss. (Recorded damage)"
"Sighting the goblins now that Dirk tossed the curtains open, Fjolnir looses his readied arrow at the closest robed lunatic. Quickly pinching two arrows he looses them in succession at the two closest dirt worshipers. Readied Arrow: 10 Dmg: 8 Att: 11 Dmg: 9 Att: 17 Dmg: 10 Hordebreaker"
Az emberi steps in and moves east into the room sticking clise to the wall. Throw stone at the one that yelled 11 dmg. 5
"The central goblin ducks behind the altar and Az Emberi's magic rock misses. Fjolnir lets his held arrow fly at the right-most goblin but it goes high, then steps forward to loose 2 more. The central one ducks again, but the right one catches it in the face and goes down gurgling on his own blood. Both goblins fire another arrow each, 1 at Az Emberi: Attack: 11 Damage: 3 and one at Fjolnir: Attack: 11 Damage: 3 For identically shitty attacks! Then they draw their scimitars and shields to rush all the ranged attackers that just defiled the temple they... defiled.  Hymir is up!"
Move north peak the curtain firebolt Hit 7 Damage 1 ... aaaaaa Warning shot! My aim is near perfect if you dont give up and answer our questions I will use my full power Deception 16 Intimidation 11
"Hymir fires a bolt that hits squarely but puffs out right at the goblin's face, not doing much damage. The Right-most/Leader Goblin yells, 'We will not be swayed! You hold no power over Maglubiyet!' You sense these particular goblins are fanatical and will fight to the death... which I'm sure you will provide ample opportunity. Round 11, FIGHT! 23-Krodmad 21-Absinthe 20-Az Emberi & Dirk 13-Fjolnir 9-More Goblins -Left one -Taken 1 damage -Right one/Leader -undamaged 8-Hymir"
Dustfinger moves out of the healing spirit to about ten feet behind Fjolnir and tries to put that goblin's eye out with an arrow. Attack 12 Damage 8 + Sneak Attack 7 And because I started my turn in the healing spirit 3 is healed. I'm adding it to my sheet.
I ba the spirit to mikes location I hit the one in front of me with shillelagh. Atk. 14 dmg. 8
"1 healing from Lee. Attack: 5 Damage: 9 crossbow attack at the goblin leads ballsack. You look like you were dressed by your own feces! No, seriously. @same target 12 deception or persuasion."
Absinthe moves in for the kill. Yklwa Attack: 18 Damage: 8 Knee to skull Attack: 9 Damage: 6
"Krodmad/Dustfinger, whatever he's calling himself these minutes, fires a great shot that just misses the goblin's head. You get the feeling if that were 2 inches left he'd be dead outright! Absinthe does indeed kill the goblin, right out from under Az Emberi, who was about to swing at it. It was going to be really gory, too. Oh, man... the gore that would have been had if only Absinthe let Az Emberi get the kill. But no, this was a rather mundane kill, which is actually a change for Absinthe... Is he going soft? Absinthe then knees the corpse in the skull. There it is! That's our Absinthe. Still not very gory though... Oh and he had to pass through the healing Spirit to get here, so 4 health happened. Anyway! Az Emberi gives Absinthe a quick 'that one counts as mine' glare, and proceeds over to the lead goblin and knocks the back of his head, but doesn't kill it. This goblin is a bit more hardy than most. Dirk shoots for the balls, and when he misses, he insults the goblin's style. The goblin is confused, as fecal matter is a common clothing adornment for the little buggers, he may have taken it as a compliment. Fjolnir is up, the goblin looks pretty hurt from Az Emberi's head crack."
"Fjolnir draws his scimitar and hand axe, and proceeds to swing wildly at the mini shit covered stink sack. Att 9 Dmg 6 Att 22 Dmg 6"
"And with an axe to the face, the goblin falls finally ending combat. What is everyone doing?"
I shrug and peek in the next room stealth. 18
I would like to open the door since I'm next in the order to see if there are any hostiles in the next room (I want to clear the place before the healing spirit leaves)
8 Check this room for anything of value... or trouble.
"Hymir and Az Emberi: Old casks of salted meat and sacks of rotting grain fill this storage area. Among the supplies, you see a bloody suit of chain mail, a heavy crossbow, and an unsheathed longsword with the emblem of Neverwinter worked into its hilt.  Dirk: Golden ritual implements — a chalice, a knife, and a censer — are carefully arranged on top of the altar. They look to be human-made from when this chapel belonged the original inhabitants centuries ago. They also look real, and worth money. Gundren, who has been following the group from room to room but staying out of combat, says, 'Is it over? Is this place clear of enemies?'"
"One more room Gundren.... and then the dragon! Weeeeee! I take everything not nailed down for party loot. Maybe keep the knife upon further inspection, tell everyone if I do. 8"
"Dustfinger begins snooping around looking for hidden stuff, like traps, secret rooms, treasure, etc. Investigation 17"
"No no, I'm the new leader of the Cragmaw. I don't feel like you were listening to me. We ended this in minutes and took a nap. LISTEN UP YOU PRIMITIVE SCREWBALLS, I AM THE LEADER OF THE CRAGMAW, as I have defeatd the previous leader. If you want to square off against me, step up.... otherwise, fall in line. You belong to me."

"'Bah! A dragon! That's hardly even. Grol was no dragon, fools! It seems the bad choice is yours. You were free to leave, now you- AHH!' Targor is cut off by a firebolt to the face. 'Curse you, Advance!' Targor lets the wolves loose.

We'll round off and say that we start an even 200' away, and any movement will start to close that gap. Pay attention to your weapon ranges, the first number is effective range, the second is max range. So for a longbow with 150/600, it means you can still shoot things from 150-600' away, but at disadvantage. The numbers of the enemies will be from left to right as you're facing them."
"Absinthe finishes chugging his ale, readies his untrusty Yklwa and dashes forward towards the future battle."
"Absinthe charges headlong into the fray, as he does. He closes a significant distance, much to the surprise of the hobgoblins marching in the party's direction. The wolves, at first simply running forward, focus on the giant of a man now closest to them, and dash to meet him. 19- Absinthe / 120' away from hobgoblins / 30' away from wolves 15- Dirk 15- Wolves / AC 13 / HP 11 / 110' away from party 1) 2) 14- Hymir 12- Az Emberi 8- Fjolnir 7- Hobgoblins / AC 18 / HP 11 / 200' away 1) 2) Targor) Taken 5 damage. 3) 5- Dustfinger Dirk, Hymir and Fjolnir are up! Az Emberi hears the sounds of combat and rushes to an exit (I'll let you decide which one, but it'll take your turn to get there. You are still unseen to them.)"
I huck a firebolt and look for cover I take cover at full cover if possible then 3/4 or I straight up go prone so if they fire at me they have disadvantage The most damaged wolf if someone hits if not wolf 1 Hit 7 Damage 7
"Fjolnir yells across the field, 'Yer mothers' were bitch lizards in perpetual heat!', as a bonus action he whispers an incantation, marking his left wolf, then draws and looses two arrows at the approaching wolves. Att: 7 Dmg: 9 Hunters' Mark: 4 Att: 9 Dmg: 3 (Hordebreaker)"
Az Emberi grabs Gundren and goes to the south exit he takes a moment to search for dragons. Perception. 18 He wildshapes to a panther allows Gundren on his back and takes off sticking close to the treeline.
Attack: 5 Damage: 6 Can I shoot something? I shoot something.  nvm.
"Dirk shoots somethi- nope, wait, he most definitely does not. Hymir hurls a firebolt and hits- nope, wait, he most definitely does not. Then he dives to the ground to make himself a smaller target. Az Emberi looks to the sky from the shadows of the castle, and sees no dragons. He feels like the coast is clear, and tells Gundren to get on his back, turns into a panther, and speeds off into the forest while Gundren holds on for dear life. Fjolnir lobs an insult, and with two arrows he strikes each wolf- nope, wait, he most definitely does not. At least he marked one. (I moved you 20' closer, because Hunter's Mark has a 90' range) The four hobgoblins smile as Absinthe gets within range of their bows. 'Fire!' They release a volley, then place their shields in front of them and march forward 30' in formation. Attack: 14 Damage: 5 Attack: 22 Damage: 7 Attack: 14 Damage: 4 Attack: 9 Damage: 3 (Oh, Absinthe, why is your AC 14?) Absinthe sees the arrows arcing toward him and 15 snatches one right out of the air. The other two do 9 damage total, but the one that would've hit you in the chest is in your hand. (as part of the reaction, you can spend a ki to throw it at something, but it's 20/60 range and I didn't think you'd want to use a ki on a disadvantage attack, so I'll leave that up to you.) Round 1: Game of Cragmaw Your distances from the things are now next to your names not next to theirs since they all got different rather quickly. I think I'm starting to get this DM thing down! 19- Absinthe / 90' away from hobgoblins / 30' away from wolves 15- Dirk / 170' away from hobgoblins / 110' away from wolves 15- Wolves / AC 13 / HP 11 1) Hunter's Mark 2) 14- Hymir / 170' away from hobgoblins / 110' away from wolves / prone 12- Az Emberi (Sir Not-appearing-in-this-fight) 8- Fjolnir / 150' away from hobgoblins / 90' away from wolves 7- Hobgoblins / AC 18 / HP 11 1) 2) Targor) Taken 5 damage. 3) 5- Dustfinger / 170' away from hobgoblins / 110' away from wolves Dustfinger is up."
"Dustfinger does what he does best, which is to make things difficult for everyone. He runs up to stand behind and to the right of Fjolnir, and then casts Fog so the periphery of fog ends just in front of Fjolnir. Then he readies his daggers."
"'Guys I'm going to need you to move in a little closer if you want to participate in this fight, I'm sure you don't want to let me have all the fun!' Absinthe mmoves 30 more feet up to the closest wolf, comes down with a mighty strike to the top of its head. Yklwa Attack: 10 Damage: 10 Followed by a knee to the chin. Knee Attack: 23 Damage: 5"
Charge for an attempt to shoot a wolf. Attack: 20 Damage: 3
"Dustfinger steps behind Fjolnir and creates a fog cloud just encasing the party members that stayed back. (The mechanics of this let you step out of it, fire something, then move back in so that attacks have disadvantage on you. If you don't move out of the cloud you will have disadvantage on your attacks.) Absinthe swings with his yklwa but the wolf dodges. He follows up with a knee to the chin that connects and cracks some of the wolf's teeth. Dirk runs forward, just breaking out of the fog cloud past Fjolnir. He lines up a shot and hits the wolf Absinthe just kneed in the face, the arrow now sticking out of its side. It looks pretty rough. The wolf still has the strength to strike, though, and along with its kin, they bite at Absinthe's legs attempting to grab hold. Attack: 23 Damage: 7 Attack: 24 Damage: 10 Each wolf sinks their teeth into one of Absinthe's legs and try to pull them out from under him in a tandem sweep maneuver that seems almost practiced. These are well trained pups. Absinthe uses his Stone's Endurance to try and shrug off some of the pain 12 and basically doesn't feel one wolf's bite, maybe because he knocked some of its teeth out. As both wolves pull on his legs, 9 14 the unhurt one sweeps his leg out from under him, knocking him off balance. Absinthe is prone and at 8 HP. Round 2: Game of Cragmaw Fog Cloud: The edge is 145' from the hobgoblins and goes 40' back from there. 19- Absinthe / 60' away from hobgoblins / adjacent to wolves / prone 15- Dirk / 145' away from hobgoblins / 85' away from wolves 15- Wolves / AC 13 / HP 11 1) Hunter's Mark 2) 3/11 HP 14- Hymir / 170' away from hobgoblins / 110' away from wolves / prone / 25' deep in fog cloud 8- Fjolnir / 150' away from hobgoblins / 90' away from wolves / 5' deep in fog cloud 7- Hobgoblins / AC 18 / HP 11 1) 2) Targor) Taken 5 damage 3) 5- Dustfinger / 155' away from hobgoblins / 95' away from wolves / 10' deep in fog cloud Hymir and Fjolnir are up."
I stand up and sigh questioning the utility of fog over the just standing up shooting and going prone I walk forward 15' feet and fire at the wolf Hit 24 disadvantage 18 Damage 7
"Fjolnir breaks his concentration on the wolf and whispers a Hail of Thorns spell, runs north about 20' and looses two arrows at the center two Hobgoblins. Bonus Action: Hail of Thorns Att: 21 Dmg: 8 Att: 22 Dmg: 8 (Hordebreaker) Hail of Thorns dmg: 7"
"Hymir, even with his vision obscured by fog, manages to hit the injured wolf with a firebolt, killing it dead with a fiery puff. The wolf yelps and falls. Fjolnir pulls an action hero move and strides forward while readying two arrows for delivery to the distant hobgoblins. His hail of thorns spell activated in place of the hunter's mark on the wolf, he releases both arrows and they each strike their target, ignorant of the fact that the creature's are hiding the majority of their bodies behind their shields. On top of that, one of the arrows bursts apart, showering its target and the goblinoid warrior on either side of it with thorns. (DEX saves for 1, 2, and Targor: 12 21 10 ) The blast happens behind shields and breaks the enemy lineup. The burst kills #2 instantly, even though he was quick to realize what was happening, he was too far gone to stop it. Targor is distracted by the arrow that hit him and is bombarded with the full force of the thorns. He falls, 'No, curse you!' Hobgoblin #1 manages to quickly block with his shield, but half the thorns get through beforehand. Fjolnir stands defiantly 130' from them. The broken rank of hobgoblins continues marching forward, as per their training. They leave their fallen comrades behind and close ranks moving another 30 feet. They stop for a second to fire arrows again, but without their leader present to give them direction, they chose different targets. #1 at Absinthe: Attack: 13 Damage: Unable to parse dice roll. #3 at Fjolnir: Attack: 4 Damage: 8 They both miss, luckily, and Absinthe is still conscious. Round 2: Game of Cragmaw Fog Cloud: The edge is 115' from the hobgoblins and goes 40' back from there. 19- Absinthe / 30' away from hobgoblins / adjacent to wolves / prone 15- Dirk / 115' away from hobgoblins / 85' away from wolves 15- Wolf / AC 13 / HP 11/11 14- Hymir / 125' away from hobgoblins / 95' away from wolves / 10' deep in fog cloud 8- Fjolnir / 100' away from hobgoblins / 70' away from wolves 7- Hobgoblins / AC 18 / HP 11 1) 7/11 HP 2) DEAD Targor) DEAD 3) 5- Dustfinger / 125' away from hobgoblins / 95' away from wolves / 10' deep in fog cloud Dustfinger is up."

"Absinthe, while still prone, decides to Grapple the other wolf. Grapple: 8"
"Dustfinger misses his shot and Dirk fumbles his, but at least he's closer to the action now. Absinthe tries to grab the wolf that just knocked him over, 9 but it slips away from him and bites down again. Attack: 20 Damage: 10 Absinthe is now unconscious. The wolf moves 40' towards the party.

I step out of the fog Man this is crazy how they are coming through this field and just letting us shoot at the from this safe distance I hope Absinthe is okay next to those wolves... oh I shoot a fireboltsat the remaining wolf Hit 24 Damage 6 Then fade back into the fog
Fjolnir darts forward toward Absinthe another 25 feet and looses an arrow at the remaining wolf. Att: 12 Dmg: 5
"Hymir blasts the wolf and gets back inside the safety of the cloud. Fjolnir rushes toward Absinthe as fast as his little legs will carry him and tries to shoot while running. He just barely misses, parting the beast's fur. The two hobgoblins advance another 30', now next to Absinthe. One of them kicks him with his foot, and satisfied by the lack of reaction that he is indeed not a current threat, the two fire their longbows at Fjolnir and Dirk, now the two closest enemies. vs. Fjolnir: Attack: 19 Damage: 6 vs. Dirk: Attack: 19 Damage: 5 Both connect.

"Move 20' forward, shoot a hob. Attack 10 Damage 7"
Round 4: Game of Cragmaw Absinthe make a death save. Dirk is up.
"I move as far forward without engaging the wolves as possible and attempt to make the Whore Goblins sleep with a terrible chant of Nobody likes you, your shit is weak. It's past your bedtime go to sleep. At level two 35 Followed by genius and solely my idea bonus reaction of Mantle of Inspration on Absinthe, Fjolnir... and someone who could most benefit from the 5 temp health and or immediate movement.  Absinthe, dial it back you ****ing damage sponge. Retreat for a second!"
Mutha ****ing Death Save 1: 14
"Absinthe's death save 7 is meaningless because he rolled it himself and succeeded. Dirk remembers that he's a bard and does bard things! He moves forward and sings a lullaby to the hobgoblins, (Lots of 6's, wow! You can move 30' forward and go around the wolf without an opportunity attack.) The hobgoblins can't resist the magical song and lay down in the grass right next to Absinthe. Then he uses Mantle of Inspiration on Absinthe, Fjolnir, and himself, because the wolf eyed him on the way by, and he is bound to be the wolf's next target. Unfortunately: If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you. (From the PHB) So absinthe does not get up but does have a buffer against instant death now. Fjolnir and Dirk can both use their reaction if they choose to move up to their movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks. But before Dirk moves farther toward Absinthe the wolf who was watching him turns around and chases him, biting at his legs. Attack: 11 Damage: 6 but misses due to Dirk still running. Round 4: Game of Cragmaw Fog Cloud: The edge is 85' from the hobgoblins and goes 40' back from there. 19- Absinthe / adjacent to hobgoblins / 25' past wolf / unconscious [X][][]/[][][] 15- Dirk / 25' away from hobgoblins / adjacent past wolf 15- Wolf / AC 13 / HP 5/11 14- Hymir / 90' away from hobgoblins / 60' away from wolf / 5' deep in fog cloud 8- Fjolnir / 45' away from hobgoblins / 15' away from wolf 7- Hobgoblins / AC 18 1) 7/11 HP / asleep 3) 11/11 HP / asleep 5- Dustfinger / 90' away from hobgoblins / 60' away from wolf / 5' deep in fog cloud At this time, Fjolnir and Dirk may move up to their speed. After that, Hymir and Fjolnir may act."
"Fjolnir takes the opportunity to dash past the wolf and close the distance to Absinthe, and tosses him a much needed Health Potion. Health Potion: 5"
"I move to Absinthe and stand between him and the wolves. Az, maybe show a little leg? Az? Shit. Slowly bend down and show them Absinthe's leg"
i step out of the fog Okay time to see whats going on again... damn this is really changing... are those goblins ****ing sleeping? lets finish off this wolf hit 14 dmg 7 back into the fog
"Dirk and Fjolnir both continue rushing to help Absinthe. Dirk stands between him and the wolf like a protective mother, then lifts his pant leg at it. Hymir comes out of the fog, and indeed finishes off the wolf. It catches fire and goes down whining, still on fire. Fjolnir continues running and slams a potion in Absinthe's mouth rather clumsily, but it does still wake the half-giant up.

"Dustfinger is somewhere between the fog and the hobos, but definitely not in the fog, and there's a hobgoblin somewhere that needs to get got, so Dustfinger is going to try to get it with his bow, presumably after moving into range. 16 Damage 8 + Sneak Attack 5"
hey it's hard to shoot a target that is laying down even if its sleeping we have time let's run up to them and attack also let's knock 1 down to but keep him alive
"Dustfinger, having not been in the fog, moves farther away from the fog still, and tries to hit a sleeping hobgob. But, since they're laying down, and he's at range, it proves difficult. It probably also would've helped if he had aimed at one specifically, and not just fired at 'a hobgoblin somewhere.'

"Fjolnir tries to finish off the sleeper (auto-crit because he's unconscious) 1 but leaves him in very poor health, waking him up with the first hit, denting his armor with the second. The two now awake hobgoblins stand and attack. One against Fjolnir and one against Absinthe. vs. Fjolnir: Attack: 23 Damage: 5 Hit! vs. Absinthe: Attack: 4 Damage: 3 Sad, sad miss.

If not, that's pretty sad and you should all retire as adventurers."
"Dustfinger runs, then cunningly dashes, towards the remaining hobgoblin, shortsword in hand, eager to sink into its warm belly. Attack 19 Damage 5 + Sneak Attack 8"
"And sink into his warm belly it did, past the shield, through the armor, into the gut, out the side, spilling entrails abound. Combat is over. Az Emberi and Gundren are safely (so far) on their way to Phandolin. It will be dawn soon, aside from whatever else you are doing, I need the Thundertree group to roll survival checks (optional) to find food for the next couple days travel, along with stealth (mandatory) and perception (optional) checks for the first leg of the journey North. Assuming you are moving at a slow pace to keep stealth. I need Az Emberi to roll survival for food, or dip into rations. Assuming you are moving at a fast pace to make up time, and perception is at a -5. Wild Shape lasts for 1 hour, and you get 2 per short rest."
As it is before dawn I cast mage armor then at dawn my staff will recharge 9 charges Perception 3 Stealth 21 Survival 19

I haul ass for the first hour. Re wildshape. Haul ass the second hour. Short rest survival 18 for food. Wold shape keep running.
"Hymir sees both Hobgoblins go down, one of which spilling intestines everywhere. He rushes to the other one yelling, 'I said knock them out you ****s! I literally said it less than 10 seconds ago! For ****'s sake guys!' He kneels down to start bandaging the wound left by Fjolnir's axe when he remembers he's seen this happen before in a vision. He calms down and knows that the hobgoblin will be stabilized but unconscious. Fjolnir scratches the back of his head with his axe, 'Oh, yeah, sorry. I got a little carried away. I heard you say that... I just forgot in the moment.' Dustfinger shrugs. 'It felt like longer than that to me, time seems to slow down in battle. But yeah, I got lost in the moment, too. Oh and I'm a swashbuckler now.' 'It's ok, no need to apologize, you acknowledged my concerns, so let's move on. Luckily, the gods have allowed this scenario to play out to that end anyway, but in the future, I'd like to have the option of keeping something alive for questioning.' The hobgoblin is stable but still KO'ed. Meanwhile, Dirk searches them all but only finds the heads of three slain elves in the bloody sacks they were carrying. No gold or usable items. Hymir's Mage armor will be active into mid-afternoon. 1"
"Absinthe Stealth: 23 Az Emberi manages to hunt in panther form and catch enough food for both he and Gundren. The primal nature of the hunt feels good, it feels right. He hauls ass south to the edge of the wood, across the plains, and finds the Triboar Trail. 20 4 10 Aside from a couple of awkward moments when the magic wore off and Gundren was riding Az Emberi on all fours, they traveled without incident. A couple of rests were taken for food and so that Az Emberi could recharge. It is easy to navigate to Phandolin from the trail. You make it there by late afternoon. Gundren breathes a huge sigh of relief as the small town comes into view, in fact, he is nearly brought to tears. 'I didn't think I'd make it back here, lad. It looked bad fer me for a bit. I know you have other business to finish up, and I thank ye fer considerin' me, but when yer done, come back with yer friends an' we'll discuss rewards! Oh what a glorious day! Thank ye!' (Az is welcome to say anything in response, this won't hinder your travel progress)"
"The rest of the party cuts up the wolves and gets an optimal portion of meat, along with scavenging some other food, and has enough to make the whole trip to Thundertree. You start heading WNW through the wood, until getting to the Western edge and heading North. You stay just inside the wood this time through, moving slowly and quietly, keeping to the shadows and making sure conversation is minimal and hushed. 16 7 Your captive wakes up after only an hour of travel and starts grumbling. It takes him a minute to fully come to and realize he is shackled on a cart headed through the woods. He yells and tries to break his bonds. 13 He fails. What are you doing?"
Az Emberi changes back to his humanoid form. Stretches his back. 'Thank you Gundren. If we survive the dragon we will take you up on those rewards. Now I need a drink and to see a couple of people about a couple of things.' He heads to the town hall to get an auduence with Sidlar Hallwinter.
"Gundren nods, 'That's where I'm headed, too, lad!' Gundren walks with you to the town hall. Sildar stands up when he sees you, then his face lights up when he sees Gundren. 'Gundren, old friend, you made it! Well done- where is the rest of your crew?' 'They went to see a dragon about a thing,' Gundren steps in, 'But hopefully they'll all be back safely, and soon.' 'Yes, Hopefully. Well, when you all get back we'll discuss rewards for clearing out Cragmaw, since I assume with Gundren present you've done that?'"
"'About that Sidlar. I've come to ask for your sword to be added in our Struggle. The dragon Venomfang has roosted in Thundertree and claimed these lands as his. He's a young green dragon now but as he ages he will try to lay claim to this town as well. My allies and I have been captured by him I managed to sneak out and deliver Gundren to Phandelver and also to bring you your gear lost to the Cragmaw. My friends and I have saved this town , Gundren, and your life in our short time in these lands. Now we ask for you, an honorable and capable warrior to aid us in our time of need. What say you friend? Will you help us and in doing so prevent this town from also falling victim to the greed of this dragon?"
I use shocking grasp or 'taser fist' non lethal on the hobgoblin Hit 17 advantage due to restrained 14 Damage 2 If it is mid day I recast mage armor I ready an action to do non lethal S hocking Grasp Taser Fist when I see him wake up
"The Hobgoblin passes out again. 2 (It's only been an hour, so it's still early morning for everyone but Az Emberi, but when it gets to midday you can re-cast it. Go ahead and mark it on your item charges now and that way there will be no lapse in Mage armor coverage) The main party continues through the wood for another couple hours. 18 9 Nothing of note happens. In the early afternoon 20 11 Nothing of note happens. In the late afternoon, Hymir senses his Mage Armor fade and immediately recasts it. Then 2 19 You all notice the Hobgoblin on the cart slip his cuffs, Hymir uses his readied Taser Fist spell on him."
Taser fist - Nonlethal Hit 17 adv 25 Damage 8 Still non lethal but damn additional 3
I keep a warchful eye on the little shit from now on.
"The little shit (although, not actually very little) is tased back to sleep again and now Dirk assists keeping an eye on him as you travel. 2 Late afternoon rolls into early evening and 21 17 Dirk notices him wake up again. You have to watch to make sure because you think for a second he's still asleep, but the breathing patterns have changed and a couple of arm muscles are twitching. Dirk and Dirk only may act before the hobgoblin tries to slip his cuffs again. (I have been basing Hymir's 'watchful eye' on his phenomenal perception roll of 3. Since no one else mentioned keeping an eye on it until Dirk just now, no one noticed it trying to slip the cuffs until it rolled a 2 on stealth, then everyone saw it at once, but the skill check to slip the cuffs was successful at the same time, thus Hymir could use his readied action. This time around, it rolled a 21 on stealth, but since Dirk's Perception is 22 right now, and he is actively watching him, Dirk gets to act BEFORE the hobgoblin finishes trying to slip the cuffs.) Meanwhile, back in Phandalin... Sildar gets even more excited when he sees you brought back all his gear. 'Wow! Thank you, Az Emberi, I thought This was gone for good. I'll need a new scabbard, I guess but oh well.' He holds the sword and smiles, but then it slowly turns to a frown when the weight of what you asked of him hits. 'You wish my assistance to slay a dragon? I have to be honest, I am both honored and humbled by what you think I'm capable of and frightened at the prospect of this at the same time. I understand the severity of a dragon roosting so close, but at the same time, I have duties here under the Lord's Alliance.' Gundren chimes in, 'Sildar, friend and protector, surely you can lend your aid to these adventurers who saved BOTH our lives. The dragon has them hostage. We'll never find me brothers, get the mine up and runnin' and bring prosperity to Phandalin as the Lord's Alliance wants ye to do, without their aid. They saved us, Sildar, We should return the favor.' Sildar looks at his sword again, then back to you, 'I'll send word to the Alliance. When are you leaving?' Az Emberi, include a persuasion roll with your reply."
"Tired, Go ahead. Slip those bonds again. I'll have big guy rip your arms off and we'll just cuff your legs. 6  Non-lethal dagger attack Attack: 20 Damage: 5"
We leave as soon as you are able. And after I speak to the Sister to try and gain her aid as well. Persuasion 4 Advantage 0
"The hobgoblin, still cuffed, growls at Dirk as he rolls his legs off the cart and runs into the woods before anyone can react, with the exception of Dirk who can make an opportunity attack. 6 The hobgoblin stumbles off the rolling cart just as Dirk's dagger pommel comes down on the back of his head. He tumbles onto the ground."
So hey.... fingers. He doesn't need fingers right? Maybe we take 2-3 off and he can't get out so easily... if at all anymore? Help load it back into the cart.
"Sildar says, 'That won't give me time to inform The Alliance.' He strokes his chin for a second. 'I'll tell you what, I will help you rid Thundertree of this threat, not as an agent of the Lord's Alliance, but as a free agent for hire. I'll take 50 gold off your reward for clearing the castle, and we'll call it even.' He smiles and looks at Gundren. 'That means you're going to have to look after my work while I'm gone.' Gundren shrugs. 'I can't do jack 'til ye all get back anyway, so whatever, lad.' Dirk helps load the still cuffed hobgoblin back onto the cart. 4"
I bear down and run as fast as I can hoping Sidlar has some good aim and they don't.
"Sildar's heavy crossbow has a long range, at least longer than the orc's ranged weapons. He manages to get one shot off before you cross the trail, then another just as you're crossing it, the orcs can do nothing but run toward you as he shoots them. Attack: 8 Damage: 5 Attack: 5 Damage: 2 The speed and bumpiness from being mounted proved too difficult for Sildar to keep steady. 'Sorry, friend, seems I'm not so good with this thing, and I don't want to get close enough to use my sword!' The orcs close the distance much faster than it appears they should be able too. These orcs can move! They end up about 100' east of you and stop in a line long enough to each throw a javelin in your direction before they continue chase. (INCOMING!) Attack: 12 Damage: 7 Attack: 7 Damage: 5 Attack: 16 Damage: 7 Attack: 6 Damage: 8 Attack: 12 Damage: 8 Attack: 9 Damage: 7 Determining if they were aiming at rider or mount: 15 (Based on the above attack rolls, this is the luckiest you could have got) Three orcs threw javelins at the elk, the other three at the elk-riding warrior. All three javelins aimed at the beast miss. Two of the ones aimed at Sildar are deflected by his armor, one pierces into his side. Sildar: 20/27 HP Az Emberi continues running North, curving slightly West to put more distance between you and the orcs. Sildar winces and takes another shot as you gallop past. Attack: 19 Damage: 1 It hits, but the orc laughs as he pulls the bolt out and keeps running toward you. They change their trajectory North and follow you, stopping again to throw another javelin volley: Attack: 19 Damage: 4 Attack: 19 Damage: 9 Attack: 6 Damage: 6 Attack: 12 Damage: 7 Attack: 11 Damage: 5 Attack: 6 Damage: 9 15 Sildar takes 2 more hits, as does Az Emberi. With 2 javelins sticking out of your flank, you push through the pain and continue running your full sprint speed Northwest away from the orcs. Sildar looks pretty rough, but he's holding on too. He takes one more shot for good measure. Attack: 7 Damage: 1 But his pain level and the rough ride sets his bolt off course. Az Emberi's Elk Fursona: 1 /13 (Highlighting how close you were to losing this encounter) Sildar: 7/27 The orcs are moving very fast behind you, but they seem to be out of javelins and trying to catch up to cut you down with their axes. Both parties continue running a few more rounds, but you slowly pull ahead toward the Neverwinter Wood. It's still miles away, but you keep running for another 50 or so minutes even though the orcs give up after a few minutes to find easier prey, you keep putting distance between you in case they decide to track you. Your form wears off, and you and Sildar both collapse with relief and mild exhaustion. You take a short rest and continue hauling as much ass as possible as an Elk, just in case. By nightfall, you make it to the wood and skirt around the Western edge as far North as your form allows. You stop for the night, getting inside the forest edge to stay hidden. Both parties are now getting ready for their long rest, I need a definitive watch order from the main group, and I need to know how Az and Sildar are going to approach watch with 2 people."
"Dirk takes first second watch, keeping the prisoner in his gaze at all times. Clearly after Hymir who has first watch using his light source."
Aright gents i guess we have to watch this guy more carefully and take extra precautions this is going to sound extreme but it seems this is what we have to do First we tie him up with extra rope to keep him restrained Then every hour hit this guy to knock him out in case he is faking and waiting to escape if he starts to go unstable use this Healers kit i picked up (puts down healers kit) i figure it has about 9 uses left so it should get us through the night i'll take first watch and we should meet up with Az Emberi as well as hopefully some help i cast light (red) on a rock and hold it in my hand shock the Hobgoblin (attack with adv 7 dmg non lethal 3 ) and check to see if he is stable if not i use a healers kit looks at fist Damn thing seems to be on the frits attack again 19 adv 23 dmg non lethal 2 There we go
"Sildar says to Az Emberi, 'That looked dicey for a minute, friend. I'm alright for a while, why don't you rest? We'll take turns and I'll wake you up when it's dark. On my second shift, I'll have to figure something out for light, but I think we'll manage.'"
Retconing some reaction to the point we ran out of wildshape. Az Emberi stops running and Sidlar gets off his back tenderly. Az Emberi changes back to his humanoid form and they both collapse. Az looks to the sky and starts laughing as he holds his side from the subsiding phantom pain inflicted by the javilin to his elk flank. Still laughing he climbs to his feet and helps Sidlar up. 'And this is just on the way to fight the dragon' 'Come friend lets find cover and rest.' They move into the tree line for cover. In response to watch order. 'My thoughts exactly. See you in three hours.' Az Emberi closes his eyes.
"The parties settle in, in their own little ways. The North group decides to watch in the order of Hymir, Dirk, Dustfinger, then Fjolnir. After settling in and eating dinner, everyone starts passing out, tired from the long day's march, except Hyimr who zaps the unconscious, defenseless hobgoblin, then uses a salve and bandages from the healer's kit to stabilize him from dying. 1 The watches commence. 15 4 5 6 2 5 About halfway through Hymir's watch, the hobgoblin's eyes flutter open, but he doesn't move. He feels that's he's more restrained than before, and simply stares at Hymir. He growls, 'Why didn't you just kill me? Why this torture? What are you doing?'"
You are not being tortured you are being detained i understand why you might think that and why you are trying to escape but it's obvious if you want to escape we don't want you to so here we are us having to prevent you because you can't sit still and what I am doing is simple we were charged to clear out Cragmaw we offered you to help us or die now you have a chance to help and possibly live here's whats going to happen I am going to introduce you to our dragon benefactor and give you a magic weapon a long sword named Talon if you can slay the dragon or damage him and run away then you are free to go simple as that Persuasion 1
The hobgoblin takes a few seconds to let all that sink in. 'You're offering me freedom if I fight a dragon? That's a death sentence.' He ponders for a moment. 'But you could have killed me already. I now do not see your failure to kill me as softness for your enemy but as tactical advantage against a greater enemy. Respect. I accept your mercy and your deal. My freedom if I survive the dragon fight. I will not try to run.' He squirms a bit. 'I can't move anyway.' He closes his eyes and tries to sleep.
Insight 8
"You are a smart man, you know when someone is lying to you. This hobgoblin is not."
"I know you aren't to be trusted but this seems fair, you have been warned while i'm inclined to believe you recognize the situation you are still under watch. I let the Hobgoblin get some rest at the end of my shift i pass on the information to Dirk and tell him to pass on the same i inform the next watch to not attack right away, simply ready your action to attack if he escapes and if he tries to escape even once to go back to the original plan. he must not benefit from a LONG rest so at the end of dirks shift hit him until he goes unconscious he may have extra health from his short rest resuscitate then keep an eye on him until morning"
15 Perception. I follow Hymir's instructions
"Dirk thumps the hobgoblin on the head at the end of his watch, ending his REM sleep and placing him in a different state of unconscious. 3 Dustfinger's watch goes by without incident. The hobgoblin doesn't even flinch and nothing else gets near the camp. In the middle of Fjolnir's watch, the hobgoblin stirs awake. 'Uunggghhh. What the ****?'"
"Fjolnir readies a non-lethal melee crack to the head- 'You flinch- i'll brain you. Fart too loud, i'll brain you. They need to be well rested in the morning, hell- you want them well rested so we all have better odds. 'make it out awrite...no one around to pester you in Cragmaw.' he sets back to continue listening to the surroundings and waiting for daybreak."
"The Hobgoblin obeys, not really able to move or anything anyway, and you don't hear a peep out of him until dawn. Everyone wakes up refreshed and receives the benefits of a long rest (except the hobgoblin, who now has one level of exhaustion, but did use his Hit dice to heal 2 8 So he will be full health for the fight). Both parties still have enough food to take them through the rest of the day, so no foraging is needed, and after breakfast, camp is broken down and everyone continues North to Thundertree. Az Emberi and Sildar get a late start to be able to receive the same benefits, but their faster movement may allow them to catch the party. Let's find out! In the meantime, while both parties travel, I need to verify and remind you of some things: Anyone who used up all their hit dice at Cragmaw gets 1 Hit die back. Make sure you mark what spells you want prepared if that applies to you. Hymir has to roll his 2 new portents and for his staff charges. Anyone else that needs to do something after a long rest, do so now. Are you feeding the hobgoblin, or is he going hungry? DM rolls: 20 5 7 4 18 2"

"(This time around dawn broke before you woke up, so mage armor will have to happen afterward.) You do not find a plump, juicy boar, but you do still have some wolf meat from his boss' pet wolves... Are you feeding him, like a child? Or are you untieing him to let him eat?"
"based on my insight roll i will untie him but his legs are still bound and he still has his manacles so should still be retrained as far as movement goes i yell out to the camp just load enough for everyone to hear me ' Prisoner untied, Heard? ' waiting for acknowledgement and i ready my action which will be slapping him in the face with wolf mean that i will use a a conductor from my fists"
"Dirtfinger lurks, Dirtfinger watches. Stealth 16 Perception 23"
"The hobgoblin eats and doesn't try anything funny. He does glare at Hymir the whole time, pretty intently."
"Hey. Look at me you shit. You belong to us now. If you want your freedom you will have to earn it. Don't get any other ****ing idea about your situation. You are only as valuable to us as you make useful. I point to Absinthe If you aren't useful, that guy over there is going to pull your limbs off like flower petals."
"The goblinoid looks up at the towering goliath, gulps, then silently finishes eating without making any more eye contact. When he's finished he pulls his legs up on to the cart and awaits the travel. He looks tired."

"21 15 You travel without incident for the majority of the day. When it reaches early evening, you feel you are only a couple miles out from Thundertree. You will most likely make it with plenty of time before sundown. Fjolnir and Dustfinger: The two of you hear a twig snap behind you. The rest of the party seems to pay no mind to it, thinking it's a normal forest noise, but the two of you look back to see a small group of goblins very quietly darting around behind you between the bushes. They've been tracking you, but they don't realize they've been spotted yet. You get a surprise round."
"Dustfinger draws an arrow and nocks it, looking to ping the nearest goblin. Attack 17 Damage 8 + Sneak Attack 7 Initiative for later 16"

A total of 3 goblins reveal themselves, all that remains of what is probably a scouting party. They clang swords against their shields and hiss and screech in a chaotic cacophony of intimidation. The pounding of hooves is heard behind them, and before anyone can react, a large beast with antlers and an armored rider burst through the bushes. Attack: 14 Damage: 7 Attack: 17 Damage: 5 The beast charges and gores one of the goblins, running it through and then slamming it on the ground with a triumphant bleat. The rider slashes at the already injured goblin and does more damage. It looks rough. He says, 'Foul creatures. Practice for the dragon, yes?' Sildar smiles at the party. 'You have a hobgoblin?' Only 2 goblins remain, 1 is at 1 HP. They are both close enough to get into melee if you want. Initiative: Dustfinger Fjolnir Dirk Goblins (2) 7HP & 1HP Az Emberi & Hymir & Sildar Absinthe"
"Dustfinger whips out both his swords and moves up to the healthier goblin for a swing with one sword. Attack 9 Damage 3 + Sneak Attack 5 Then he bounces over to the other goblin, who is ten feet away from the first one, to swing with his other sword. Attack 21 Damage 8"

"Dustfinger swashbuckles around the battlefield without attracting attacks of opportunity, and kills one of the goblins. Fjolnir brings the other goblin within an inch of his life. Dirk shrugs and looks around, 'Was that it?' He fires his crossbow at the weak little thing. 18 The dart sinks into its chest and he falls with a squeal. Combat is over. (If you want to do any RP or finalizing the plan for the dragon fight, now is the time. During the fight, you'll only be able to say short sentences on your turns.)"

I ba shift to be a little more wolfy and ready gust of wind aimed at venomfangs face to go off on his turn when he starts to take an action.
"Dustfinger rushes in to slash at the dragon, fumbles the strike and rushes back out as if he was never there. Hymir steps into view to restrain Venomfang with Earthen Grasp. Having foreseen this exact moment in a vision, he knew what he had to do to make it stick. The magical hand grabs one of his hind legs and does some minor damage. He returns to cover. Absinthe lets it all hang out and leaps at the dragon's neck. 21 Venomfang swats at him, and Absinthe loses his grip for a second, but just barely keeps his hold. He digs a bludgeoning strike into its scaly hide, seeming to take effect. Az Emberi shifts and holds a small gust of wind swirling in his hands, ready to release it once Venomfang attacks something. Dirk casts Faerie Fire, being careful to only include Venomfang in the area of effect. 10 The dragon's green hide now sparkles like a lavender glitter bomb. After Dirk's scathing insult, Fjolnir feels his will bolstered. If Dirk is so brave in the face of danger, we might be alright! Venomfang seems even more incensed at Dirk's antics. Noxious fumes start to escape from his nostrils. Silence! Zhermong snatches Talon from Dirk and moves around to Venomfang's flank. Your fall will be my ascension! He slices at the dragon's thick hide. Attack: 22 Damage: 9 Extra Martial Advantage Damage: 6 He lands a solid hit, slashing into its right rear leg. Venomfang rears back to release a torrent of gaseous breath in Dirk's direction. As he does this, Az Emberi sends forth a blast of wind at his face. The strong wind makes the breath attack much less effective, though not totally. Sickening green gas that burns the lungs and skin is blasted across the ground all the way back to Fjolnir. Hymir and Dustfinger do not feel the effects due to their cover, and the wind works quickly at dispersing the cloud, not allowing it to sink in and have the desired effect. ( Dirk and Fjolnir must make CON saves , with advantage due to the wind gust. Dirk is immune to the damage regardless, so he can take it right in the face with no issue, and Fjolnir is resistant, so he will take half of whatever number the damage is even on a failed save. DC 14 49 Poison Damage. So Fjolnir would take 24 damage on a failed save, 12 damage on a successful save. After taking damage, Fjolnir has to make a CON save to see if he can maintain concentration on Hunter's Mark. It is based on the damage taken so the DC will depend on whether or not he makes the save.) Venomfang lets out a roar of frustration and glares upward. He tries to break his leg out of Hymir's Earthen Grasp. 24 and succeeds. He is no longer restrained. He ignores Absinthe on his neck for the time being and moves back to the East wall, letting the naked goliath dangle as his necklace. Dirk may make an opportunity attack , still advantage due to Faerie Fire. Sildar sees gas fill the room he was about to rush through, then strong winds come through the doorway. 'Nope!' He runs to the window and fires inside at Venomfang with his crossbow. Attack: 19 Damage: 10 The bolt sinks deep into his left side. Fjolnir is up.  Round 1: Venomfang!

"Inspired by Dirk's taunting 3 , Fjolnir spins on his heel and turns away his face to let breath break on his shoulder like foam over a gunwale. 23 He tries to maintain his concentration on the mark- 16 He spits dragon phlegm and acrid poison back at the creature, yells 'The sun is setting on your kind, lizard!' and looses an arrow before stepping to his left about 5 feet. Att: 20 Dmg: 5 Hunter's Mark: 2 Amend Constitution save: 20"
"The combination of the Gust of Wind, poison resistance, and Bardic Inspiration allow Fjolnir to only take a minor amount of damage from what could have been a devastating attack. (You take 12 damage) He maintains concentration on Hunter's Mark and fires an arrow that makes it through the wind and strikes the dragon in his shoulder.

"Dustfinger steps in front of the open doorway and braces himself against the wind, firing an arrow at the dragon. He then steps back to cover at the side of the door. Attack (disadvantage from wind cancelled by advantage from faerie fire?) 13 Damage 6 + Sneak Attack 10"

Advantage addendum: 9
"Dustfinger and Hymir take turns peeking through the door to make attacks and dive back behind cover and out of the wind tunnel. Dustfinger misses the glowing dragon, but Hymir grabs one of its legs again with his Fist of the Ancestors. Az Emberi continues blowing wind into the tower and chucks a stone down on Venomfang's head, doing considerable damage for a little rock. Absinthe and Dirk are up. Round 2: Venomfang!

"Opportunity attack, I draw my rapier. Attack: 16 Damage: 6 Constitution save 17 7 advantage Strength save 10 Dragon, is it just your dragon's breath attack, or is it your actual breath that smells like your diet strictly consists of eating sick baby diapers. Beings as I'm already near or next to Fjolnir, level 1 cure 5 and Give Absinthe some bardic inspiration this time OOOONNEE PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH!"
"Absinthe, in all his naked glory, swings his Yklwa at the dragons eye in an attempt to gouge it out completely. Yklwa Attack: 23 Damage: 8 Followed by a punch to same eye. Eye punch Attack: 20 Damage: 4 And again with a Ki point. Second eye punch Attack: 22 Damage: 6"
"Dirk's attack bounces off Venomfang's hide as he moves backward. Absinthe pummels the ever loving shit out of Venomfang's eye. While it does not gouge it completely, it is now swollen and bruised. Venomfang howls and instinctually rears his head, but cannot escape the large naked goliath's onslaught of fists. Dirk is blown back by Az Emberi's Gust into the cottage room. He stands up and gives Fjolnir a heal since he ended up there anyway, and gives Absinthe inspiration to try and finish the job. 'I'm going to make my throne from your hide, worm!' Zhermong slashes again, trying to widen the wound he opened previously... Attack: 22 Damage: 5 Extra Martial Advantage Damage: 10 ...and hits the same exact spot. The wound is deep now, showing muscle tissue. Venomfang howls as blood sprays Zhermong's armor and shield. Zhermong chuckles with delight. 6 Venomfang roars loudly enough to rattle dust off the walls of the tower. He pulls his leg away from the Earthen Grasp... 15 and slips free. Enough of this! You will now face your DOOM! Venomfang flips his neck forward, swinging Absinthe out and up in front of his mouth. He bites at Absinthe's swinging... leg. Attack: 18 Damage: 20 Peircing + 11 Poison. His teeth sink deep into Absinthe's flesh, the pain is excruciating, and there is also a burning sensation from lingering poison inside the dragon's mouth. Absinthe feels his grip fading, his vision tunneling, but pushes through the pain and hangs on by a thread. Know your place insect! Venomfang swipes again with a claw, like a dog removing a flea. Attack: 23 Damage: 11 Claws scrape across Absinthe's ribs and he can no longer maintain his grasp. He falls off the dragon's neck and hits the floor in a bloody pile, still breathing, but barely. Venomfang lashes out with his other claw at Zhermong. You will have no throne. Attack: 21 Damage: 8 The hobgoblin reels from the blow, but stays on his feet. Then Venomfang leaps into the air and beats his wings against the strong current put forth by Az Emberi's Wind Gust. Zhermong takes another opportunity to strike at the dragon's unprotected flank. Attack: 23 Damage: 9 Widening the wound still. 'That remains to be seen.' Venomfang struggles and beats his wings furiously, propelling him slowly upwards, until his two front claws grasp the edge of the hole in the roof, and he pulls himself up. He stands adjacent to Az Emberi and the edge of the hole. His breath is labored, but he snakes his head toward Az Emberi's face. Cunning, wolf-boy, but not strong enough. As he talks, Az Emberi notices glands on the inside of Venomfang's mouth, ripe with poison, waiting to be expelled. Sildar watches the dragon fly up through the roof. ' Dammit!' He runs to get an angle on him and fires another bolt. Attack: 19 Damage: 9 A solid 'thwak' is audible as the dragon takes the bolt in his neck. Venomfang reels. He is starting to look rough. Note: Venomfang and Az Emberi are on the roof, Everyone else is on the ground floor. Round 2: Venomfang! Tower: 30' Diameter, 40' Tall, Spiral staircase to top.

I drop gust. Then on turn 'Its not very cunning of you to back a wolf into a corner.' Thunderwave as a level 2 24
"'Every day we face our doom!' Fjolnir yells while running out the back door North East, about 20', drawing and loosing another arrow at the beast on the roof, 'We're prepared to die, are you?!' He shouts. Att: 20 Dmg: 5 Hunter's Mark: 3"
Dustfinger does the same thing as last time. Attack 22 Damage 6 + SA 9
Having realized he only has a basic firebolt and a poison attack Hymir stays with his earthen fist Attempt to regrab he know makes a str saving throw against 13 or take 6 and be restrained I attempt to run up and give absinth a potion strength save 6 So seeing different outcomes in the future has taken a toll on Hymir he now runs up and gives Absinthe the potion everyone sees him do this thing with no hesitation but in his mind he went through multiple scenarios what if he did this spell what if he needed to make a str saving throw but these were all possibilities in his head what he actually does is give a potion to the big guy you was doing a super job. 10
"Fjolnir barrels through the door and gets a good angle on Venomfang. He sinks an arrow deep in the perched dragon's side. He winces and his hind leg gives out for a second. Dustfinger pushes through the wind into the room to see up the tower at the dragon. He aims carefully, only able to see the top half of him. He fires, and his arrow plants itself into the eye Absinthe damaged already. Venomfang screams in pain, his neck swinging around wildly as blood trickles past his closed eyelid. Az Emberi drops concentration on his Gust of Wind. Hymir runs across the now windless tower to shove a healing potion down Absinthe's throat, waking him up just in time to look up and see... Az Emberi cast Thunderwave after a cool one-liner. BOOM. The sound echos through the entirety of Thundertree. 23 Venomfang resists being knocked off the tower, digging his claws into the roof, but the force cracks several of his ribs, and shreds his wings. He staggers backward on his hind legs, blood pouring out of his mouth from internal wounds. He tries to speak but can't get more than a couple of words out at a time. No... This isn't right... He promised... That I would live... Forever... Venomfang tries to breathe poisonous fumes at Az Emberi but his lung capacity won't allow it. His foot slips off the roof and he tumbles sideways trying to catch himself in the air, but his shredded wings merely cause him to spiral toward the ground. He lands outside of the tower with a wet thump combined with the cracking of bones. He lays motionless as Dirk says a eulogy:"
"Dear Limpfang. I thought this would be the fight of our lives, that I would regale crowds with tails of this battle until the end of my days. But this is the most disappointing battle I've come across, and I kissed a man in combat. It's so disappointing I fear I will forget your name entirely within a week, relegate this day to little more than a day of chores. Your name and form to be long forgotten. People around here will probably remember the spiders more, now they were scary. All I get is a loud gecko with the flu, who charges away from me following my devastating attack. If I can intimidate you into attacking my subordinates so easily..... I... I just don't know why I'm putting in the effort. You'll probably just, scurry away like a rodent..... Hello? HEELLOOOO? Hey! *******! He's ignoring me? I ****ing hate it when people ignore me."
"Zhermong you have earned your prize and your life you will get no apology for what i had to do but whether it means anything to you, you have earned my respect as well. i trust you will make good on your side safe passage for you to leave and us to pass through. i would like to be on gaurd in case he attacks me and i would like to ready an action to prevent Sidar or anyone from attacking or taking his sword. we did it gents we can rest easy."
"Hey Z, Thought you might want a trophy, I was thinking a claw or entire arm? You would likely have to contend with the big guy over the head... he likes to drink out of those. Perhaps we can do business in the future, I like your moxy."
Wildshape spider scurry down to the group shift out. I clap hobgob on the shoulder casting cure wounds 6 . You fought well Zhermong the first. I look to Sidlar with appreciation. If not for you two the day might have gone differently. Lets eat and drink together before going our seperate ways. Is Green Dragonmeat poisonous? Nature check 14 ? I look to Absinthe. 'How are you holding up big guy?'
"OK, I think Dustfinger usually takes 2nd and Fjolnir 4th, Right? We'll go with that so the non-darkvision-ers don't need light to keep watch, as per the usual. Dirk takes first watch, nothing happens. 20 About halfway through Dustfinger's watch, 4 arrows fly from the edge of the wood toward him.

Four total hobgoblins are in your camp. The ones on Dirk and Az Emberi come down at their heads with the hilts of their longswords: Dirk: Attack: 9 Damage: Unable to parse dice roll. Az Emberi: Attack: 20 Damage: 8 (I noted damage on both your sheets) Initiative: 14 Az Emberi and Dirk may roll initiative and act. Absinthe and Fjolnir are asleep and restrained with rope around their wrists. They can be woken up but cannot act until the next round. They can roll initiative if they want, to act when they're awake. Dustfinger is at 0 HP but stable, also restrained with rope. He cannot be woken up normally, but any healing will wake him, at which time he can join the initiative order. Forgot about Sildar! Here's there too. 12"
Dustfinger succumbs to the relaxing healing of acupuncture and naps. Sleepy Initiative 10
"20 Initiative I stand up, cast suggestion on my would be captor. You must wake everyone up for the tea party. Then you may entertain us by fingering your own butthole. Bardic inspiration on Az Embari for being adorbs."
I jump up assess the situation. Initiative 12 I cast thunderwave on the highest numper of targets possible. Dc save or dmg 6 The thunder should wake everyone up ba shift. Move to dustfinger.
Porkchop sandwiches 12
Initiative to get the hell out of here! 5
"Absinthe: 3 Dirk reacts quickly to the accidental rousing by the hobgoblins, after being cracked in the head, and casts suggestion on his would-be captor. WIS Save: 20 His eyes gloss over for just a second until he shakes his head and snaps out of it. 'Wait, there's no tea party!' Az Emberi is also knocked on the head but jumps up and blasts #1 and 2 with a Thunderwave. CON Saves: 3 5 They are both blasted back 10 feet and are shaken by the blow. Everyone else is thrust into consciousness with the exception of Dustfinger who is still out. The two hobgoblins pushed backward by Az Emberi form up and charge him in unison. The one Dirk cast suggestion on swings at him. The one that tied up Fjolnir takes advantage of his prone state. vs. Az: Attack: 20 Damage: 9 vs. Az: Attack: 20 Damage: 5 vs. Dirk: Attack: 21 Damage: 4 vs. Fjolnir: Attack: 16 Damage: 6 (Brutal) Extra Martial Advantage damage: 7 Az Emebri is blitzed and ends up in bad shape.

"I cast Faerie Fire in the 20ft cube space that seems to hit Hobgobs 1-3 and Absinthe. Mantle of inspiration on Az Emberi, Dustfinger and my sexy self. I immediately move to the south of Dustfinger. I don't know what these ****s want, but I want one of them for myself. A price will be payed for this insolence. You have no idea who we are, but you are about to find out what we are capable of!"
"Dirk throws a magical glitter bomb that encases 3 hobgoblins and Fjolnir in its area. (It looks to me that he would be in the cube, not Absinthe, let me know if you think that's wrong) DEX Saves: 17 6 6 Sildar springs to action and grabs his unsheathed sword, two-handing it at the now glittering form of the hobgoblin that realizes this is no tea party.

I have added it to your sheet.) Az Emberi may use his reaction to move up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks before his turn. Az Emberi, Hymir, Dustfinger (If Az or Hymir wakes you up) and Fjolnir are up!"
"Having rested on the trail South, Fjolnir was recovered slightly ( 18 ), he rolls over from his bedroll (Faerie Fire save 19 ) to the axe along side and tries to cut the restraints 11 . Tossing the rope aside and jumping to his feet he barks, 'Your mother is much better with tying knots, ya know...' and whispers a hunters' mark on the 4th Hobgoblin."
Free move to east of Absinthe Ba untie him Thunderwave down to hit thise two again 5 Assumong theyre dead or pushed i use my movement to go just east of dustfinger.
"I stand up we have safe passage from the hobgoblin king who sent you, and while you think of your answer Hobgoblin seeking Missle. I cast magic missle lvl 2 at H1 2 H1 5 H4 3 H4 4 Which I shoot in the opposite direction to show how much they change direction to hit thier mark with full proof accuracy"
"Az Emberi utilizes Dirk's mantley inspired movement to break away from the hobgoblins and get close to Absinthe. He unties him while the big man is still trying to get to his feet and then casts Thunderwave at them again. Saves: 4 10 The thunderous wave blasts them back 10 feet. One of them is folded in half by the force of the blow and dies before he hits the ground. The other lands on his head and the inertia of his body wrings his own neck. Hymir shoots some magic hobgoblin seeking missiles in the opposite direction that arc around him to hit his intended targets in an impressive display. Two missiles hit each hobgoblin at the same time. The blast knocks #3 off his feet. He does not get back up. #4 is in pain and it shows. Dustfinger is still un-awake. Fjolnir Manages to get himself free and get on his feet while making fun of the last hobgoblin's mother, literally adding insult to injury. The hobgoblin watches his whole party die at once, then retorts at Hymir, 'I know you're lying, King Grol gives no one safe passage! And he's a bugbear, you dolt! ' He steps back from Fjolnir (Disengage action) and runs into the woods, wincing through the pain. 'My mother didn't- Oh, I get it. **** you!' The woods will count as difficult terrain, and also give half cover from ranged attacks. The hobgoblin is just on the edge of the map.

Absinthe jumps to his feet and charges towards the fleeing hobgoblin. 'Everyone you know is dead and looking forward to meeting you! Or something like that!' Yklwa Attack: 22 Damage: 4 Punch to spine Attack: 11 Damage: 5
"Fjolnir notices Absinthe's earnest movement and immediately follows suit thinking it wise, and prudent. He looses the first arrow at the two southmost orcs and spits his remaining chew out. '****ing weird, man...' he retorts to Az Embari, 'Just weird.' and knocks and looses a second. Longbow 26 dmg 9 Hordebreaker 16 dmg 6 (crit) 9"
"Absinthe keeps pace with Dirk and stands menacingly, as goliaths do. Fjolnir gets within optimal firing range and lets loose 2 arrows that both hit. The first bull's eyes right in the center of its ugly face. It falls like a tree into the thorns. The second is hurt but not out. Dustfinger joins the front runners along with Sildar. Hymir misses with his cleansing fire, but he's close enough to do more damage next time. The orcs...  Ah these unfortunate orcs... having stopped dead in their tracks, literally for one of them, froth with rage. One in the back yells something in a language you've never heard, and they all crouch to leap in different directions. 15 22 8 18 8 It's a bloody mess as all of them yell in painful anger, the pain seems to fuel their hatred, but two of them lose their footing in the spines and fall into them. #Thisisgoingtohurt : 5 4 4 4 3 Extra damage for the fallen: 3 5 The ones that fell are definitely worse for wear, but they all survive the endeavor. They have scattered out and blindly charge the party, using their aggressive nature to push them farther then they should be able to run in that amount of time, and still be able to huck some javelins, albeit rather wildly.

"Stepping forward about 20', Fjolnir lovingly sends an arrow to the 2nd Orc, in closest reach of the party- Longbow 22 dmg 3"
I move max to behind absinth and Sidlar. I ba healing word to absinthe 4 Ready stobe for the first orc that makes it 60 ft of me 9 dmg. 9
"I stand up from prone, advance 10 ft and crossbow shot Orc #2, the shit orc. Attack: 6 Damage: 5 Apply mantle of inspiration on Sildar, Absinthe and... and... who else could use.... this.... Fjolnir."
"Dirk's arrow misses the orc and sticks into the ground beside him. His mantle of inspiration, however, gives Sildar, Absinthe and Fjolnir a boost of energy. Sildar charges in another 30 feet. Absinthe and Fjolnir: You both gain 5 Temp HP and can move up to your speed as a free action that technically happens right after Dirk's turn, Before Az Emberi's. Az Emberi also moves 30 feet toward the orcs, and flings a rock that misses orc #2. (You got within 60' no need to use your ready action. Also, I will hold your bonus action healing word to see if Absinthe even needs it, and if he's in range after getting free movement. Pending that, if you'd like to use another bonus action you may.) I will resolve Fjolnir's turn and take Sildar's turn after Absinthe goes. Round 2: Orcs! 23- Dirk 20- Az Emberi (Concentrating- Spike Growth) 19- Absinthe 16- Fjolnir 13- Sildar (5 temp HP) 12- Dustfinger 9- Hymir (Bardic Inspiration / Prone) 9- Orcs 1) Taken 5 damage 2) Taken 4 damage 3) Taken 7 damage (looks hurt) 4) Taken 4 damage 5) Taken 14 damage (looks rough)"
Shrug damage: 3 Move up to the closest orc with a slight graceful sway. Pulls out his Yklwa and... Yklwa Attack: 22 Damage: 9 Followed by a sweet kick to the stones Attack: 6 Damage: 3
"Absinthe shrugged some of the bone piercing damage, and Az Emberi healed some more, bringing him to a total of 22/24 HP. Absinthe staggers orc #2 with his yklwa which actually causes his next strike to miss. But that works out since it allows Fjolnir to land the killing blow on it. Orc #2 goes down. Sildar shouts, 'That one was- I was right- Rrrrrggh!' And runs to Orc #5. He swings twice once with his longsword, cleaving it in two!

"Dustfinger centers himself as purple energy crackles around his left hand. He inhales deeply and lunges the palm of his hand in the direction of the lone orc to the north (#1), belting out the word of ancient power to send the surge of power towards its victim. 'HADOKEN!' EB attack 11 Damage 2"
"Hymir stands, moves 15 feet, and thinks, Huh, I thought they'd be closer, and more grouped. He shrugs and throws another mote of flame. Um, you I guess. Attack: 7 Damage: 10 Orc #3 dodges a really good firebolt, probably Hymir's best. The orcs charge Sildar and Absinthe, leaving bloody footprints along their path, and their fallen brethren fuel their anger. With giant greataxes, they swing at their targets. #1 vs. Absinthe: Attack: 14 Damage: 14 #3 vs. Sildar: Attack: 23 Damage: 11 #4 vs. Sildar: Attack: 19 Damage: 12 All the strikes hit. Sildar, even with his bonus hit points, is looking rough.

"Fjolnir stands still and shouts, 'Yew ****in shovel headed knuckle dragger...' He sights up the south-most Orc and looses an arrow '... lay down and fertilize the turf with yer rotting guts!' Longbow 7 dmg 5"
"Dustfinger rushes forward thirty feet, and lets loose a blast of angry purple power at the orc giving his pal a hard time. Orc #3 unless Sildar kills it before this action pops off, then Orc #1 instead. EB Attack 7 Damage 6"
"Absinthe pummels orc #1 with his goliath fury. Yklwa: Attack: 24 Damage: 7 Kick in the nuts attempt 2: Attack: 5 Damage: 4 Attempt 3 with ki: Attack: 10 Damage: 6 The ord looks rough from the yklwa attack, but continues blocking gonad strikes, much to Absinthe's frustration. Fjolnir has more luck with his racial slur than his attack. He picks up his arrow that he just dropped and hopes no one noticed that failed attempt at punctuating what would have been a nice kill. Sildar, some of his wounds closing from magical healing, swings at orc #3: Attack: 5 Damage: 4 Attack: 14 Damage: 2 His second strike connects, but only enough to mildly bruise its arm. Dustfinger is not quite grasping this whole ranged power attack thing yet, maybe with time, or a different approach, or a different power word, yeah, that will help! Hymir has personally had enough missing his targets. He shouts, Orcus Exterminus! and lets three magical darts fly out of his hands into the sky that curve downward onto two different orcs. Orc 1: 5 Orc 3: 4 Orc 3: 2 Both of his targets die on impact. Orc #4, now seeing that his companions are all dead, and none of his 'prey' is down, screams a battle cry and swings at Sildar knowing it will probably be the last thing he does. Attack: 14 Damage: 15 Sildar angles himself to the orc's swing and the greataxe ricochets off of his chain armor.  Round 3: Orcs! 23- Dirk 20- Az Emberi (Concentrating- Spike Growth) 19- Absinthe 16- Fjolnir 13- Sildar 16/27 12- Dustfinger 9- Hymir (Bardic Inspiration) 9- Orcs 1) Dead 3) Dead 4) Taken 4 damage Dirk and Az Emberi are up.

Position myself close enough to throw my last rock. 20 dmg. 6
Attack: 18 Damage: 8 attempt to rend this last one unconscious attack with my rapier.
I whip out my bagpipes and blast a rendition of Metallica with a prestigitation cast of fire streaming out the back ends. BA bardic inspiration on Az Emberi.

"I sleep in the nude. Absinthe is startled awake by the elaborate performance of Dirk, let out a loud growl as I jump to my feet and with no time to dawn clothes start slapping the shit out of which ever of those things I can reach first. Yklwa shit slap Attack: 17 Damage: 4 Backhand shit slap Attack: 7 Damage: 5"
I get right under them or maybe a little off to the side and yell I am fueled by BACON!!! burning hands lvl 2 to hit as many as possible half on save DeX DC 13 14 fire damage
"Hymir hits 2 of them with his bacon fueled fiery attack. They burn up and die nearly instantly. Absinthe gets up close and gets ready to swing with his Yklwa, and just as one gets in close he swings and skewers it. As Absinthe is shaking the thing off his weapon another one dives at him. Attack: 14 Damage: 6 It drives its pointed mouth right into Absinthe's flesh and starts sucking his blood. Its claws dig into his abdomen as it attaches itself to him, and the creature starts to swell. The other one flies down to Fjolnir and attempts the same. Attack: 20 Damage: 6 It succeeds as well and is now attached to him. Anyone can use their action to detach a stirge from anyone, including themselves. Round 1: Mosquito-bats! 21: Dirk 20: Absinthe (Has Stirge Attached) 20: Hymir 19: Stirges: 1) Attached to Absinthe 2) Attached to Fjolnir 17: Dustfinger (Prone) 13: Az Emberi (Prone / Bardic Inspiration) 4: Fjolnir (Prone / Has Stirge Attached) Dustfinger / Az Emberi / Fjolnir You're up!"
Dustfinger hops up and sprays the back of the stirge on Absinthe's face with purple green energy. EB 14 Damage 8
The stirge attached to Absinthe shrivels up and falls to the ground. The last one is feeding on Fjolnir. Az Emberi and Fjolnir are up.

"Whispers to Dirk, 'I hope you'll be helping us out with your fancy lights inside.'"
Absinthe sneaks into Grapple range stealth: 17 Then proceeds to strike the orc in the back of the head. Yklwa to head Attack: 6 Damage: 6 Punch to stomach Attack: 8 Damage: 6
"With a combination arrow and magic rock attack, the lone orc goes down before he is alerted to your presence. Absinthe doesn't even get halfway to him before he dies without a sound save him hitting the ground. There are no other orcs in the vicinity outside the cave, but you're still a ways from the entrance."
Dustfinger stealthily approaches the cave's mouth and examines its dimensions. Stealth 23
I follow stealth 5
"The cave is wide, about 40' at the mouth, but it narrows and turns before the edge of your darkvision. From around the corner you can hear voices echoing though the cave, but there's no way of telling how close they are."
"Dustfinger strains to hear, listening for anyone speaking in goblinoid, elvish, or common. Perception 8"
"None of those languages are being spoken. The language that is being spoken is much harsher, and the cave echo makes it difficult to make out regardless."
Az Emberi listens at the cave to figure out useful info Perception 25
Init 18
Initiative 10
"4 ......... Just testing something here, disregard. 38 22"
"Dustfinger lets go of Az and pulls his double-bladed scimitar. Whispers to Az, pressing the darkened bearing into his hand, 'Looks like they made us, bud. Close your hand on the bearing if you want to hide the darkness, or just chuck it up ahead of you.' Dust then murmurs a new incantation and duplicates himself, a spell that requires surprisingly little mental effort compared to the darkness."
Initiative: 18
"Absinthe, upon hearing the orc roar, let's out a loud bellowing roar of his own in response. Intimidate: 1 then runs in to join his party members in the darkness. 'I'm going to need some light if you want me to go any further or be much use at all.' Planting my self in a decent spot to attack the first one that rounds the corner."
"Fjolnir continues to creep stealthily and stays in tow, about 25'-30' back, just at the edge of Dustfingers' palpable darkness- when they hesitate a moment, he continues to re-ready himself, with one arrow nocked and ready for any hostilities, and another pinched in his bowhand. He stops a moment to keep a huge pork-laden fart pinched and contorts his face in effort."
"Fjolnir gets 25' into the cave, holding his arrow ready in case something hostile come through the darkness, or until it goes away and he can see something deeper in. He's also holding his cheeks together. Dustfinger gives the ball bearing enchanted with darkness to Az Emberi, wields a double-bladed scimitar and magically creates 3 illusory copies of himself that stand with him, but still remains inside the darkness. Absinthe lets loose a mighty squeak then bravely runs right into the sphere of darkness. He can't see his own hand in front of his eyes but he's ready to strike anything that gets close. A commanding voice echoes through the cave in common. You haven't heard this voice yet. It's louder, more gruff, the owner of this voice has seen some shit. 'What's going on? What wizardry is this? Many Arrows Tribe, attack the darkness! Gog! Wake up! Time to smash!' A rumbling fills the cave as Gog apparently wakes up and two large pounding footsteps are heard, followed by a loud roar of a deep bellowing voice. Absinthe: The voice is from deeper in the cave and speaks in giant: 'GOG SMASH!' Dustfinger (and no one else) sees a larger orc run from the South around the corner. This orc is heavily scarred, most notable of which are the two scars that go straight back past both corners of his mouth, and both of his bottom tusks are cut off at the same height. (I know the rest of you can't see him yet but this saves me from forgetting to tell everyone what he looks like.) He lobs a javelin at the center of the darkness (AKA, Az Emberi) Attack: 6 Damage: 6 The javelin hits nothing, Az Emberi doesn't even know it was aimed at him. At the same time, Hymir... Round 1: Orc Camp 21- Fjolnir 18- Absinthe 18- Dustfinger (Concentrating on Darkness) 15- Orc Leader 15- Hymir 11- Orcs 10- Az Emberi 7- Gog 4- Dirk"
"i move up to the darkness and let out a deep sigh, because once again my vision has been obscured even though i'm a spell sniper, I cast earthen grasp randomly in front of the darkness so the orcs can see not grasping anything but putting it out there and make it mock out the song of little bunny foo foo and i accompany it with song 'Little bunny Foo Foo Hopping through the forest Scooping up the field mice And boppin' 'em on the head! Performance check 11"
"For just a brief second Fjolnir looks over his shoulder painfully confused at Hymir and forgets to clench, nearly shitting his tunic with wincingly bad tainted wind."
"Right after Hymir does that, the orcs file in to follow their master's orders, each lobbing javelins at the darkness. Only Dustfinger sees how many, but Az Emberi counts the javelin strike sounds. Six. There are six orcs, aside from their leader, and a Gog, whatever that is. Attack: 10 Damage: 9 Attack: 9 Damage: 6 Attack: 15 Damage: 8 Attack: 15 Damage: 9 Attack: 12 Damage: 4 Attack: 13 Damage: 7 They are proficient at attacking the darkness, because that is all they hit.

"'I think it's time for me to dawn my grappling attire!' Absinthe drops his robe revealing his Goliath dong once again, which no one can yet see since I'm in the darkness. 'That giant is going down, or something like that!'"
"'I'm tired of fighting these mother ****ing unknowns in the mother ****ing unknown.' I drop the bearing in my pocket to drop darkness. I stepup to orc 2 and if my math is right a 15 ft cube will hit 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. I cast level 2 thunderwave they do a dc 14 dex save or take. 7 thunder dmg and get pushed back. Half on sucess. I yell 'Dirk can we fairie fire these unkown unknowns?' Ba shift to be more wolfy."
"Inspiration to Az Emberi for Samuel Jackson-esque dialogue. Indeed! You can hit those very orcs, Here are their individual saves: 4 / 20 / 11 / 10 / 19 A thunderous BOOM fills the cave, made even more impressive by the echo. Orcs 2 and 6 hold fast, albeit a bit shaken. Orcs 1, 3 and 5 tumble backwards. Seeing so many orcs at once after the darkness drops, Fjolnir isn't sure which to release his arrow at. He sees 3 tumbling backwards and thinks maybe that would be funny. Attack: 17 Damage: 7 Sure enough, as it rolls backwards it finds an arrow right in its ass cheek. That particular orc is looking rough. Absinthe held a melee attack, so he can't do much from where he is. You all hear pounding footsteps as a lumbering figure stomps out from behind a natural column. 'HA HA! BRUGHOR SAY GOG SMASH! SQUISHY MEAT! HA HA HA!' He sounds like... he's not all there, but it's not his fault, ya know, his parents did their best with what they had. I mean, look how little room there is for brain in there. Poor fella. You guys know at this point it's basically a hate crime? He rushes the party with surprising speed for his size and weaves through the now dispersed orcs, giggling in a low, childlike voice.

"I move as far as I can staying to the left and aiming north next to Absinthe. I cast Bear's endurance on him laying a hand on his shoulder. 6 Don't get to carried away, but do Smash things. BA mantle of inspiration on Hymir, Fjolnir, Az Emberi and myself. Immedietly taking the opportunity to run far north along the left side of that looped passage.

I use mantle to move just north of absinthe
"Inspired, Fjolnir runs following Dirk, about 25', and stops at the entrance to the looped passage around the boulder and puts his back to it to grab some minute bit of cover."
"Fjolnir, Absinthe and Dustfinger are up. If Hymir wants to move 30' he can, which happens before Fjolnir's turn. After all that, Hymir and Brughor are both up, so it'll be whichever one of us gets to it first.

"Dustfinger rushes up to Ab's left flank and Technoviking points toward the unfortunate Gog for whom the bell tolls. Their ringing fills the air, growing dread in every clang. Toll The Dead, Gog makes WIS save vs 14 or take 1 damage."
I say I hope somebody brought the funk... because here comes the noise! I cast shatter on the top right of the big guy it's a 10ft radius so it should hit enemy except #4 con save of 13 for half thunder damage 14
"'...Stinking ****ing Orc...' Fjolnir draws two arrows, and whispers a Hail of Thorns conjuration on one. 'Felek inbar' and looses one at the legs of the Fatarse, and then using Hordebreaker skills, a second at Orc 2. Longbow 24 Dmg 10 Hail Of Thorns 10 @ Fatarse Gog Hordebreaker 26 Dmg 7 @ Orc 2"
"Fjolnir fires two arrows, the first one loaded with piss and vinegar. It strikes Gog and encircles him and everything adjacent to him in a thorny storm, to maximum effect. They all try to maneuver to lessen the blow. DEX Saves: 19 / 7 / 21 / 7 / 4 Gog and Orc 1 (Orc 1 was already dead, I forgot to delete him from the map, so only Gog saved from full damage) manage to not take full damage from the thorns, but the arrows are deadly enough. Orc 2, 6 and Brughor Axe-Biter all take 10 damage from the thorns. The second arrow and the Hail of Thorns were enough to kill Orc #2. Absinthe is up.

"Absinthe swirls his dong in a hypnotic pattern while charging straight at Gog. The poor, simple ogre is mesmerized, jaw agape until Absinthe is upon him. Absinthe lands all three hits against the distracted giant-kin, who snaps out of his hypnosis and starts laughing. Dustfinger Tolls the Bell at Gog (but he doesn't really understand what happened) and rushes up to stand by Absinthe. Hymir casts Shatter in the air near Gog's head and catches most of the orcs in the fringe of the spell. CON Saves: 21 / 8 / 17 / 20 / 11 Gog, Orc 3 and 5 withstand some of the damage. Brughor and Orc 6 take the full brunt, and it proves too much for orc 6 to continue standing. Absinthe and Dustfinger must also make CON Saves. DC 13 . A successful save gets you 7 damage, a failed save is 14. At the same time the air was shattered, Brughor yells: Kill them! and rushes Absinthe swinging his greataxe. Attack: 25 Damage: 19 and hits, critically! Absinthe, you may as well add your shrug damage roll to your CON save post, you might be hurting otherwise. The three orcs left alive follow orders and swarm around Absinthe and Dustfinger, also carrying greataxes. Dustfinger: Orc 3) Attack: 14 Damage: 9 Targets the real Dustfinger, but misses!

Con: 14 Shrug damage: 4
"After Brughor maims Absinthe and the other orcs brutally murder one of Dustfinger's illusory copies, Az Emberi calls down a beam of light on the large, infantile-brained ogre. He looks confused for a moment as he is bathed in dim moonlight, then it starts to sear his flesh. CON Save: 8 vs. 14 Radiant Damage. He screams as only a confused child can while being engulfed in spectral flame. His confused pain turns to anger, and since he has no idea what just happened, turns it toward the only thing he can reach that he knows hit him: Absinthe. Attack: 26 Damage: 23 (Wow, second crit on you this round! I swear I'm using the same dice you guys are.) With a large overhead swing that is surprisingly quick, Gog catches Absinthe with his greatclub and pins him to the ground. 'SQUISHY MEAT, SQUISHY MEAT! HA HA HA HA!' Absinthe is unconscious. Dirk is up, and Fjolnir can post too. If neither of you is able to get Absinthe up he will need to make a death save.

"I survey the battle with scrutiny. Absinthe down and surrounded, I feel the need to make the area safe enough to save him, and since there's no one else who can get hurt.....sleep. Of the highest caliber (with inspiration), draw my lute and sing the anthem that brings all life crashing to sleep. Anvilania.... 32 on that whole messy area. Placing a little inspiration on Fjolnir in case he immediately needs the inspiration."
"Cackling at the absurdly protracted crooning from Dirk in the face of gore and death in the bowels of the earth, Fjolnir approaches Absinthe and delivers arrows to the Fatarse and Orc 5: Longbow 11 Dmg 10 @ Fatarse Gog Hordebreaker 11 Dmg 4 @ Orc 5"
"Fjolnir fires two arrows at level with each other, one sailing right over the orc it was intended for, but the other slicing through Gog, on account of his girth. He gasps for air and raises his hand for a second, then his eyes roll back and the last of the air leaves his lungs. (MURDERERS!) Absinthe: 20 wakes up on his own. That mother****er is really hard to kill. Dustfinger does some fancy moving with his double-bladed scimitar. Like a baton he twirls it back and forth, he lands one blade on orc #3, killing it, then comes back less emphatically on Orc #4, doing 10 damage and waking him up.

"Absinthe let's out a loud yawn, 'Man there is nothing like a nice nap during the heat of battle. How are we doing? Did we win?'"
"Almost, you weren't the only one who needed a nap in the heat of battle. I say, sounding just like Absinthe."
I look at my earthen grasp which has still been miming the song and in an overly stern and serious voice compared to the children's reference I say go pop me a field mouse The hand rushes over to O4 Strength saving throw 13 nothing happens on save 13 10 crushing damage and restrained on fail
"Hymir moves up to get the Orc in range to pop him. STR Save: 16 The hand comes down on the prone orc, who stops it and pushes it off of himself like a bench press. Brughor continues snoring. The orc that just maxed out his press jumps up to see all of his tribe down. He eyes the exit, and brandishes his greataxe, but doesn't see a good way out. He roars in anger and swings at Dustfinger and his mirrors. 2 Attack: 7 Damage: 4 He swings at the real Dustfinger, but the copies are enough to confuse him to the point of making a poor strike.

"Run forward and crossbow attack 4. If he's dead I shoot 5, if he's dead well... then.... I don't know. Attack: 8 Damage: 8"
Az Emberi focuses and moves the moonbeam around Dustfinger and onto Orc 4. CON Save DC 14: 9 or 4 Radiant Damage. The orc howls as it comes within an inch of its life. Az Emberi then slings a Healing Word at Absinthe for 5 Healing Damage. Dirk is up!
Dirk misses orc 4. Fjolnir Absinthe and Dustfinger are up.
"'Ay, AY back to sleep, you!' Fjolnir walks about 10' closer to the action and looses an arrow at Orc4, intending to ultimately leave the leader Berg... Burgh... Burgerface alive for questioning. Longbow 8 Dmg 8"
"Dustfinger swings at the unfortunate orc who is awake enough to witness its own death, with a mind to stick the sleepy one afterwards. Attack 10 Damage 12 If this hits and kills Orc 4, move to Orc 5 for ba attack. If it doesn't, ba attack resumes on Orc 4. If O4: Attack 18 Damage 6 If O5: Attack (adv, EA) 26 , Damage 8"
Absinthe starts stomping on orc 5 Stomp Attack: 13 Damage: 7 Second Stomp Attack: 16 Damage: 6 Then proceeds to shackle the leader.
"Between Stomps and slashes, Absinthe and Dustfinger finish off the last two orcs. Brughor Axe-Biter is now cuffed behind the back."
"You wake up the orc leader and he starts roaring and biting at those of you encircling him. You instinctually pull back your extremities, even without his tusks he could probably sever a finger. After he realizes his situation he stops and glares at all of you, growling. Az Emberi asks, 'Did the Black Spider hire you, are you working for him?' 'The Many Arrows Tribe works for no one! Raaaaggghhhh!' He bites at Az Emberi, more for show than to try and do actual harm."
"Fjolnir walks over to Brughor... 'Axe-biter... eh?' He pulls Hew from its tieback and pantomimes biting the beard of it.. 'Bah- Best start bargaining for your life, limbs, clothes, teeth, or eyes- because you're gonna lose something, and what you bargain with determines what you keep . Your raids on the town of Phandalin and the Triboar end either way. What say ye...?'"
"You really need to dial it back and listen to the dwarf. We are Bowel Shift, and we typically only leave pieces in our wake. WE, who slayed Venomfang, the dragon. I make sure to inspect Brughor's appearance, mannerisms as he flails about, speaks and notable features. I want to know just who you are and who these Many Arrow are. Resistance will be met with an axe, comply with our questions and demands and you may just walk out of here mostly intact. 17 Intimidation (Note, I will be dismembering all fallen foes from now on and arranging the parts in odd yet deliberate ways.. if nothing else)"
"Dustfinger hangs back at Dirk's side, giving his best Biggie Smalls browbeating impression to help Dirk help Brughor remember things."
"'I don't care who you are, or what you killed, we don't work for nobody, and we don't answer to nobody! Not the Black Spider, and definitely not some group of shit-head cowards that needs to sneak up on people to win a fight!' Brughor struggles against the manacles. 15 They remain unbroken even though veins start to show on his forehead. 'Rrrraaaaggghhh! We're gonna go on killin' and takin' what we want, and you sure as hell ain't gonna stop us!'"

Those are my zombies! Oh you've already killed one! C'mon!' Fjolnir, Dustfinger and Dirk, you have the option to change your turn or do something else.

"Not hostile, zombies? Are you saying they aren't trying to kill us? Did not change turn, supplimented."
"Dustfinger, mid-finger wiggles for summoning up his mirror images, sees and hears the red wizard emerge and lets his initial desired spell's energy fizzle before even getting cast. Understanding that the wizard is just reacting to the party, rather than encouraging the assault, Dustfinger tries to quickly defuse things the only way he can: with darkness. He summons up a sphere of dark and moves up to the wizard, blinding him and obfuscating him from everyone else. 'No, YOU 'c'mon', old man. What are you doing out here letting your rotters just attack anybody?'"
'What I see here is a necromancer building an army. Give us a reason not to put you down and them back in the ground.'
"Fjolnir, seeing the sheer number of zombies pouring over the half wall, decides a Hail of Thorns is in order. Even though it was not a good shot for Fjolnir's standards, Zombies are surprisingly easy to hit, and the thorns burst out of the first arrow, spraying it and all adjacent zombies with 6 piercing damage.

'Still killing my zombies!? Fine! You're making a lot of assumptions, wolf-man! A guy can't search old ruins without...' he trails off as he casts a spell he had as a held action.

"Also, the person that emerged from the tent is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin, a shaved scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. Anyone can make an Arcana check, DC 10: You recognize the tattoo as a necromantic symbol. Or a History Check, DC 10: The garb as that usual for Thay, a land far to the east where wizards pattern their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard’s school of magic.

"Fjolnir feels his muscles tense after he releases his arrows on the zombies. He stops moving, unable to do anything but stare straight forward at the zombie horde he unleashed at. Fjolnir is now Paralyzed. Dustfinger blinds the wizard in magical darkness. 'My 'rotters' didn't attack anyone, but you lot did!'  Dirk tries to get clarification from the red wizard, to which he replies: 'No they wouldn't attack if you didn't hit them first, they're my protection! But you haven't given me reason to call them off!' At the same time, the zombies advance through the spiked ground. 1st 5': 4 / 2nd 5': 5 Zombie #5 CON Save: 17 By all accounts, the zombie now in front of Absinthe should be dead 2-3 times over, but it's carrying on.

"21 sure why not figure out who this is before the team kills him. Arcana Me? I didn't do anything. Can't exactly blame anyone for not attacking the undead on sight, you should post a sign. At that though, I will not engage your entourage. I'd encourage my compatriots to leave this scholar and his pets alone? When it is my turn, I'll hang back to the wall and have a sit."

"The wizard listens to Dirk but doesn't say anything. Absinthe jumps South out of the spikes with no problem, but this warrants opportunity attacks from all three zombies he was adjacent to. Attack: 12 Damage: 5 Attack: 21 Damage: 2 Attack: 22 Damage: 6 I will mark your damage. Absinthe then rushes into the darkness at the last known location of the wizard, and stops when he bumps into him. 'I have control of them, large man, and I'll stop them when you stop hitting them.' Then Hymir hits them with Acid Splash. 17 / 12 #12 gets a couple drips of acid on them. 13 basically to no effect. Then Az Emberi hits them with Ice Knife. 14 He deftly slings the shard and sticks it in the zombie's side, but it doesn't fall. Then the shard explodes.

Half of you want to talk and the other half want to fight, how am I supposed to deal with you if you can't even get your shit together between your own party?' Dustfinger may make an opportunity attack if they want, because the mage is moving away from them.

"You can put them away now, and mine will simmer down. We were justified in attacking these things given what little we knew at hand, just don't make the mistake of crossing us, me. Tell me, what are you doing in a place like this, in the company you keep?"
"'NECROMANCER!' Dustfinger yells. 'Your best course of action is to let your dead rest! Only you can be accounted for ceasing these hostilities! We are here at the behest of frightened villagers, and what reasonable person is not frightened of the undead!? When we arrived, our expectations were only confirmed when your zombies came towards us! Of course we had to respond! We don't know your intentions, and you've show no regard to announce yourself or your work to anyone nearby. Our response is rational, and it is you who must take the lead in good faith if we're to reach civility!' Persuasion 5"
"'I've commanded my zombies to stop. They won't attack you any more.' Confirming this, his zombies are all standing motionless. 'You'll receive no more hostility from me, so long as you no longer make any attacks. Are we done fighting now? Would you be so kind as to lower your spikes? I seem to have trapped myself back here.' The zombies have skipped any actions on their turn. Absinthe, Hymir, Az Emberi, you're up in initiative, or we can end combat and move to open discussion."

"Hymir charges a fiery Kamehameha wave, blasting a hole right through the middle of the thing. It is still moving and trying to repair itself, but it is definitely very hurt. Absinthe throws an uncharacteristically boring dart. It hits but dissolves shortly after. As Dustfinger moves away to cast Hex and Eldritch Blast on the one that's falling apart, the other one lashes out a pseudopod arm at him Attack: 16 Damage: 9 Acid. The pseudopod slap burns his skin, but he gets his attack on the other one, holding a concentrated stream on it until it starts melting. Its form dissipates and there is nothing left but a clear puddle. Dirk swings with two weapons which cut through easily but seem to have little stopping power. He insults the thing, but doesn't even know if it can hear him, and instead uses Mantle of Inspiration to help himself and some of the adjacent people to clear away from the adventurer-eating block of goo. He targets himself, Az Emberi, Fjolnir, and Dustfinger . All of you get 5 temp HP and can use your reaction to move up to your speed before the Cube's turn.

"Dustfinger lacerates the goop out of this thing, realizing it's difficult to impress your enemy with amazing flourishes of the blade when your enemy is a mindless jelly, so his strikes are uninspired hacks and slashes. Attack: 25 Damage 9 Bonus Attack: 14 Damage 6"

"Hymir lobs a fiery bolt that can't help but connect with the cubic creature. Absinthe backs up to throw a dart and the cube pseudopods him in his bitch face Attack: 12 Damage: 7 Well it tries to, but Absinthe dodges it easily. He hits with his dart, but that's not really impressive, literally all he had to do was make it through the door. Dustfinger deftly slashes the easy target 2 times for significant damage. Dirk hurls a magic laden insult at the creature... to no effect. It dawns on Dirk afterwards that this creature probably does not rely on hearing. The cube slams into Fjolnir who is already adjacent to it, then moves NW to Hymir, attempting the same. Both of them make DEX Saves: 19 / 9 Both of them jump backwards instead of staying in the creature's path, but it moves again, due North, in an attempt to consume Hymir, Dirk and Az Emberi all at once. DEX Saves: 21 / 3 / 10 Hymir is engulfed but both Dirk and Az Emberi jump backwards. Hymir takes 13 Acid Damage and can't breathe, is restrained, but may use an action make a DC 12 STR check on his turn to try to escape to an adjacent square.

"Dustfinger moves into the room, keeping to the wall at his left (3 squares to cube). No need to give the slime a twofer with him and Fjolnir. On his way, he concentrates his curse (still active Hex spell, ba to transfer, strength is disadvantaged) onto the cube, bringing his blade up for angry twisting slash. He then backs away (2 squares), almost daring the cube to lash out at him. Att 14 Damage 10 + Hex 5 If cube takes attack of opportunity that does damage: Dustfinger roars with pain, his skin glowing from an internal fire that erupts out of his mouth and eyes to coil around his arm and spray out from an accusing finger pointed at the cube.

"Hymir bursts out of the cube before he gets digested, but it takes a swing at him while he runs. Attack: 22 Damage: 5 Even with shield that would get through and the wizard takes it. Absinthe move into the room and sinks another dart in, even though Hymir already saved himself. Dustfinger, with the help of his Hex, carves a deep wound into the side of the jelly, which stops moving and starts to melt into nothing. Combat is over.

"After the team has finished their slumber party, Dustfinger summons his dancing lights again and shoots them down the unexplored hallway. One light above him, three others spread out down the hall 20' apart from each other as far as they can go."
"Hymir notices with his passive investigation that the dirt he was standing on at the end of combat has been deliberately disturbed. Not recently, but there was definitely some digging done here at some point. All of you receive the benefits of a long rest. Full HP, half total Hit dice, All abilities etc. Az Emberi notices something in the 10x10 hallway leading out of this room to the next. Or maybe it was in the next room? Either way, it seems to have been a glimpse of something glowing blue."
Dustfinger moves into the hall.
"Dustfinger makes a DEX Save vs DC 18 or takes 19 Cold Damage as a magical rune pulses at his feet, then explodes. On success he takes 10."
"I search the room, primarily where the cubes melted away. I heard these things can carry treasures lost, where is the treasure? Adventurers just lie their asses off at the pub I tell ya."
"Dustfinger jumps like a scared cat, holding his balls, as the freezing spray shoots all around him. 'HACHI MACHI, THAT'S COLD!' Dex Save 6 'Hey, guys, there's still traps.' Dustfinger groans and goes fetal for a little bit, hands in crotch."
"Dirk doesn't find anything that would have been within the cubes. As they were transparent, anything they couldn't digest would have been visible during the fight if it were inside them. While Dirk is searching through jello and everyone else is doing nothing, Dustfinger rests a bit to shake off the cold. Hymir: You need new Portent rolls."

It is unlocked and contains: 95 = 7 Gems worth 50gp ea. and 3 other items: 90 A short sword, a brooch, and a wand. After Hymir identifies all 3 over the course of your rests, he gleans the following: The brooch: Brooch of Shielding The wand: Wand of Magic Missiles The short sword: Weapon, +1"
"Wow Hymir. Nicely done. I'm not the type to look for such things, I'm impressed."
"Dustfinger steps back into the hall just before the place where he set off the cold trap. He declares loudly this is where the cold trap was. He advises no one test it to avoid freezing one's nuts off. Dustfinger brings back the dancing lights, and they dance for him, within the appropriate range of each other but spread out as far as possible to gain maximum viewing of the hall."
"We should try this tactic I heard of. This one guy, almost completely naked save a blue thong and a stick would investigate every step in order to ferret out traps. And since no one wants to take initiative, this is how I'm proceeding. 12 Perception and I'm going to try and inspect every square block before I step on it! 20"
Dirk gets through the rest of the hallway without incident. He peers through the doorway into the next room. To the North is a set of doors completely blocked by rocks. Along the South wall is a doorway to another room and straight across is another small hallway that turns sharply South.
Investigate the rocks to see the feasibility of clearing the way. 9
"Dustfinger follows Dirk and nods to the ruined portal to the north. 'That looks like something our Goliath friend could put his back into.' Dustfinger moves carefully north along the eastern wall, watching for anything amiss. Inv 2 Per 16"
"The room is large and set up like a place of worship with two support columns in the center. You can picture that there may have been pews or somesuch seating arrangement that would have faced the altar many ages ago. At the far end of the room is another caved-in hallway. Nobody hears or sees anything moving, because nothing is... until you break the threshold of the door. At that point, you see four of these: Sans chew-toy. There is nothing left to eat here.

"The creatures hiss, trumpeting the start of combat. Absinthe perks up like a dog about to go for a walk, then bounds down the hallway with a strange mixture of a dancer's grace and an elephant's charging power. He unclasps his robe halfway down the hall and leaves it behind, letting his new nipple ring glisten in the dancing light. New magical shortsword in hand, his only regret is that he wasn't closer to the room when he heard the call for battle. You don't know where he placed his yklwa. Perception DC 15: It's in his pack you sickos! He gets to the doorway and, not wanting to stay out of the action longer than he has to, uses his ki to push himself farther into the room, still managing to get into melee with one of the ghouls. 'May my blade give you eternal rest, or something like that!' He swings his sword at it twice: Attack: 21 Damage: 6 / Attack: 11 Damage: 8 The first strike jabs into its midsection, breaking the seal on the pungent odor of death, but it dodges the second. Az Emberi concentrates and spiked vines push up through the stonework, making difficult and deadly terrain. As he does so, a 10x20 section of floor between the two pillars crumbles down, revealing a large pit trap! The spikes extend the width of the room, and from the altar to about 10-15' from the East wall. Hymir rushes into the room, assesses the situation and plans his next move based on the position of the undead within. The two ghasts go different ways attempting to safely wade through the spikes. The South one takes 4 Damage as soon as it gets into them. The North one gets right to the edge and slashes at Absinthe with his claws. Attack: 21 Damage: 7 Absinthe feels his muscles begin to tighten, 22 but he shakes it off and steels himself against the effect. Dirk, Fjolnir, Dustfinger , You're up!

"Dustfinger barrels down the hall and stops short next to Hymir. He quickly surveys the room and makes the 'healthy' ghast to the south wish it had never been... uh... born?... with vigorous bird flipping and insults to its... uh... mother? 'Lights out!' he shouts, trading his dancing lights for a nasty curse, alerting the other party members, now in the dark, that the lights have, in fact, gone out. Dash + Hex (the spell) causing disadvantage to Str checks"
"Fjolnir draws two arrows and bobs just barely through the doorjamb at the sound of action; 'Allright, here we...Shite! What in ten hells...?!' He sights the Ghoul and Ghast engaging Absinthe and looses at them. 'Dark magic, animating tossed snot-rags?!' Longbow 16 Dmg 11 Hordebreaker 10 Dmg 4"
I run dash to the South eastern corner of the room cut off by the bramble. Sing Absinthe a little inspiration about beating the meat.
"A disembodied voice comes from nowhere and sings of meat beating. Absinthe feels like he could punch the whole goddamn world now. Dirk stops singing before he stops moving. No one knows his current location. Fjolnir fires two arrows at Absinthe's new combat buddies. The first arrow strikes the ghoul for considerable damage, right through the torso, the second misses the ghast. Dustfinger runs into the room warning his fellow adventurers of the impending darkness, then Hexes the South Ghast. The ghouls... do not know what to do. They stand confused for a second but move through the spike growth regardless, seemingly with no other options. Ghoul 1 attacks Absinthe: Attack: 10 Damage: 7 Advantage because Absinthe can't see them: 16 CON Save: 13 Absinthe doesn't see the attack coming, but he again shakes off the paralyzing effects of the creature's claw attacks. Ghoul 2 gets to the edge of the thorns and takes a step in, practically pushing Ghoul 1 out of the way so it can attack Absinthe as well. They both take piercing damage from the spikes: 1) 6 2) 7 Ghoul 1 actually just falls over from the shoving and doesn't get back up. Ghoul 2 claws at Absinthe: Attack: 23 Damage: 8 Absinthe shrugs some of the damage: 7 and tries to shrug the paralyzing effect: 12 Success! Ghoul 3 creeps through the spike growth taking 9 damage, unknowingly moves right past Dirk, and charges at Hymir, frothing at the mouth. It manages to get into melee with him. Ghoul 4 spends longer in the spikes and takes: 17 damage. It also moves right past Dirk unknowingly. Absinthe, Az Emberi and Hymir are up! (If Absinthe doesn't post by morning I will for him.) Round 1: Ghastly Ghoulies Lighting: Darkness 22- Absinthe 20/35HP (Bardic Inspiration) 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Spike Growth) 17- Hymir 15- Ghasts 1) 2) Taken 4 damage / Hexed (STR) 9- Dirk (Invisible) 6- Fjolnir 4- Dustfinger 3- Ghouls 1) Dead 2) Taken 7 damage 3) Taken 9 damage 4) Taken 17 damage, looks rough"
I move south east 1 square and lighr a torch Ba healing word absinthe 7
I dont know you get back Burning hands lvl 1 dex save of 13 for half 11 fire damage
"Absinthe notes the horrible smell coming from the ghast, but takes shallow breaths and focuses on attacking. He swings blindly at where he knows the ghast was last, hoping for a hit. Attack: 7 Damage: 6 / Attack: 10 Damage: 5 Then throws a kick in for good measure. Attack: 15 Damage: 5 The kick connects but that's all. He stays put until he can see where he's going. Az Emberi lights a torch for the vision impaired and heals Absinthe a little. Hymir's stranger danger sense activates and he blasts the approaching ghoul with fire. 19 But it dodges the brunt of the flames. The ghast on Absinthe continues its onslaught Attack: 9 Damage: 6 but now that Absinthe can see, he easily dodges it. The Southern one tries to carefully step through the spikes along the same path the ghouls did before it but takes 7 points of damage. It brushes right next to Dirk, looks at the space confused, and continues rushing forward toward the party. It makes it right next to the ghoul in melee with Hymir.  Dirk Fjolnir and Dustfinger are up. Round 2: Ghastly Ghoulies Lighting: Torchlight 22- Absinthe 27/35HP (Bardic Inspiration) 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Spike Growth) 17- Hymir 15- Ghasts 1) Taken 5 damage 2) Taken 11 damage / Hexed (STR) 9- Dirk (Invisible) 6- Fjolnir 4- Dustfinger 3- Ghouls 2) Taken 7 damage 3) Taken 14 damage, looks hurt 4) Taken 17 damage, looks rough"
"Dustfinger intercedes on the hexed ghast who smells like urine and looks to be attempting to make problems for Hymir. With a flash of the scimitar and spin into a backswing, he attempts to remove its head. Attack 10 Damage 10 + Hex 6 BA Attack 14 Damage 8 + Hex 3 Elven Accuracy to first attack 20"
"'Smashface, just pick up and toss the dried out turd in the pit!' Fjolnir says, as he sights the same Ghoul and Ghast draws two arrows and looses at them. Longbow 19 Dmg 11 Hordebreaker 18 Dmg 9"
I run to just out of arms reach South of the creature immediately SE of Hymir and urinate on its back. I whisper Dustfinger a pep talk about second chances.
"Dirk runs and jumps over the edge of the spikes in order to get close enough to the ghast near Hymir to pee on it. The ghast is thoroughly distracted. He then gives Dustfinger a Bardic Inspiration. Fjolnir lets two more arrows fly at Absinthe's assailants, this time both hit, but they are both still up. Absinthe replies, 'I was going to, I couldn't see them!' Dustfinger slices and dices the ghast. with the help of his hex, he manages to accomplish his goal of severing its head with a strike from either side of the neck. The ghast crumples to the floor. The odor is nearly unbearable. Ghoul 2 attacks Absinthe: Attack: 19 Damage: 7 Ghoul 3 attacks Hymir: Attack: 15 Damage: 10 Ghoul 4 hears Dirk run and jump right past it, and sees the origin of the pee stream, so it moves 5' North and takes a blind swing at Dirk: Attack: 15 Damage: 9 Absinthe takes a hit and makes a CON Save: 22 He is fine. Hymir must either take the damage and make a CON Save, or use his reaction to cast Shield. (I'm pretty sure what you'll do.) Dirk got hit, even at disadvantage. He must make 2 CON Saves: 1 for concentration on Invisibility: 21 , and 1 to resist the effects of the claw attack: 14 Dirk manages to both stay invisible and not succumb to paralyzation. after that, Absinthe, Az Emberi and Hymir are up. Round 2: Ghastly Ghoulies Lighting: Az Emberi's torchlight 22- Absinthe 20/35HP (Bardic Inspiration) 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Spike Growth) 17- Hymir 15- Ghasts 1) Taken 14 damage 2) Dead 9- Dirk (Invisible) 6- Fjolnir 4- Dustfinger 3- Ghouls 2) Taken 18 damage, looks rough 3) Taken 14 damage, looks hurt 4) Taken 17 damage, looks rough"
I cast thorn whip on the goul diagonal to Absinthe. 16 dmg 4 it is pulled 10 feet through the thorns if atk is successful. Spike dmg 7
"Absinthe attempts to grab the ghast by the shoulders. 16 vs 22 But the creature slips out of the way. Frustrated, he grasps at the creature again. 17 vs 11 This time grabbing the ghast's left forearm with his right hand, and just for good measure, coming in with a left hook. Attack: 8 Damage: 7 But even holding the thing it manages to dodge the strike. Az Emberi lashes out with a thorny vine that successfully wraps around the ghoul's leg, pulling it out from under him. The vine drags it through the spikes, tearing it to shreds. This ghoul is no more. Hymir is up! Round 3: Ghastly Ghoulies Lighting: Az Emberi's torchlight 22- Absinthe 20/35HP (Bardic Inspiration) 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Spike Growth) 17- Hymir 15- Ghasts 1) Taken 14 damage 2) Dead 9- Dirk (Invisible) 6- Fjolnir 4- Dustfinger 3- Ghouls 2) Dead. 3) Taken 14 damage, looks hurt 4) Taken 17 damage, looks rough"
Shocking grasp to the ghoul next to me I said I don't know you 8 damage 6
"Hymir botches his taser fist and it seems to not matter that the ghoul is unknown to him. The ghast claws at Absinthe with its free hand. Attack: 12 Damage: 14 What would have been a particularly nasty strike is thwarted as Absinthe jerks the ghast's arm and makes it miss. Dirk, Fjolnir, Dustfinger are up. Round 3: Ghastly Ghoulies Lighting: Az Emberi's torchlight 22- Absinthe 20/35HP (Bardic Inspiration) 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Spike Growth) 17- Hymir 15- Ghasts 1) Taken 14 damage 2) Dead 9- Dirk (Invisible) 6- Fjolnir 4- Dustfinger 3- Ghouls 3) Taken 14 damage, looks hurt 4) Taken 17 damage, looks rough"
I ask the creature south of Hymir as a help action/distraction Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world? EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Bardic inspiration to Fjolnir for.... uh hymir i guess.
"Dustfinger lunges the pointy end of Toby-Toby at the ghoul by Hymir and rakes upward, to use the momentum to bring the second blade around in a twirl to also rake up to finish any unfinished business, if necessary. But that other ghoul hasn't escaped his sight... Attack 15 Damage 12 Elven Accuracy 35 BA Attack 21 Damage 6 If the first attack kills the first ghoul, move Dustfinger down to other ghoul and apply BA attack to it. Otherwise, both attacks go to first ghoul."
"As the most annoying sound in the world rings through Fjolnir's ears, he draws and sails another arrow at the Ghast irritating the Goliath. Longbow 14 Dmg 10 bardic inspiration added to d20? 2"
"Dirk sings a horrible note in the ghouls ear, which makes it shudder, and somehow inspires Fjolnir to be... better. Fjolnir fires away at the Ghast in combat with Absinthe. (You hit without the inspiration, so you can save it if needed.) The arrow strikes it in the side. Dustfinger slices the ghoul swinging at Hymir, leaving a sizable gash that crumples him. Foul smelling dark blood oozes from the wound. He then rushes to the other ghoul, but misses with the other attack. The ghoul swings at Dustfinger after dodging his attack. Attack: 17 Damage: 10 and hits him hard. Dustfinger must make a CON Save DC 10 . Absinthe, still holding the ghast's arm, whips it around between himself and the pit. Both Absinthe and the ghast take 7 piercing damage from the spikes. Absinthe lifts his foot 20 vs 22 ...feeling inspired... 5 and Spartan kicks his ass into the pit. The ghast screams and lashes its tongue around, until it hits the bottom. It takes 3 bludgeoning damage from the fall and 5 piercing damage from the spikes. The sound it was making abruptly stops. Absinthe leaps out of the spikes and stands next to Fjolnir and Az Emberi. 'I'm not going in those spikes again, you guys get the last one.' Az Emberi and Hymir are up. Round 4: Ghastly Ghoulies Lighting: Az Emberi's torchlight 22- Absinthe 13/35 HP 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Spike Growth) 17- Hymir 15- Ghast 1) Dead? 9- Dirk (Invisible) 6- Fjolnir (Bardic Inspiration) 4- Dustfinger 5/27 HP 3- Ghoul Taken 17 damage, looks rough"
Con Save! 18
I drop concentration on spikes ba stones huck one at the last ghast 18 dmg 5
"With perfect aim, Az Emberi whips a rock at the last ghoul. The invisible Dirk has to duck out of the way and the rock smashes the ghoul in the face. The light goes out in its eyes, along with the last of the magic keeping these things alive for centuries. (Just enough damage to end combat.) Combat is now over, what are you doing?"
Use my passive investigation to look for treasure and traps around the room and into the subsequent hallways Perception and stealth whenever we do move on 7 21 respectively
"Dustfinger peers into the void... I mean the pit, for the remains and loot of any previous unfortunates. Inv 18 Per 2"
"The party searches various parts of the room for traps and treasure. No one finds any more traps in the room, but the East doorway is filled with rocks similar to the one found previously. The South exit is filled with cobwebs. The ghouls and ghasts carry nothing on their person, and the one that was kicked into the pit is skewered. But also at the bottom of the pit are piles of bones from long dead corpses, picked clean, dusty, and deteriorated from time. Among the bones you notice something else, a glint of something untouched by the ravages of time buried under them."
I spider shape down there to check it out
"You sift through the bones with your spidery appendages. 24 5 161 You find 2 potions of healing, the magic in them somehow still good, and a scroll with a single spell on it 75 Witch Bolt"
"Nothing happens. The screeching fades and the hallway goes quiet...  ...for a few seconds, until two large spiders appear out of thin air, one in front, and one behind the party:  One attacks Fjolnir: Attack: 24 Damage: 12 The other attacks Absinthe: Attack: 23 Damage: 10 (Damage applied) Initiative: 16 Both Fjolnir and Absinthe need to make a CON save, DC 11. On a failure you take 14 Poison damage, or half on success."

Initiative: 14 Con save: 12
"After a painful bite, Both Fjolnir and Absinthe feel a numbing sensation start to cover their entire body, but they resist the full effects of the poison. Absinthe is a little worse for wear, and Dustfinger is still hurting from the ghoul fight. The spiders loom over the party, towering over you with their long legs.  Hymir: 14 Dirk, Dustfinger and Absinthe are up! Phase Spiders 23- Dirk (Invisible) 22- Dustfinger (5/27 HP) 17- Absinthe (3/35 HP) 16- Phase Spiders 1) 2) 14- Fjolnir (28/44 HP) 14- Hymir 8- Az Emberi"
"'Klados!' Dustfinger utters his word of power, placing one hand behind the other and fanning fingers in opposite directions before spreading his arms wide. Black and sickly purple energy crawls down to his fingertips and becomes four new Dustfingers. The small group moves in unison north to the edge of the pit.  TL;DR: Mirror Image"
"Absinthe loses his shit on the one in front of him. Sword Attack: 19 Damage: 10 Thorax punch Attack: 9 Damage: 6 Ki kick to spiders stupid face Attack: 20 Damage: 5 'If I die here today, concider yourself haunted... Or something like that!"
I move behind the north spider and Attack: 6 Damage: 3 shortsword with dagger attack Attack: 24 Damage: 2
"Dirk uses his invisibility to let loose an unfortunate double attack, doing only minor damage. Dustfinger makes magical copies of himself and gets to better position. Absinthe hits it with his shortsword, glances a blow off the thorax, but cracks it in the... chin?... with his foot, almost having to do the splits to get his foot that high. The North spider attacks Az Emberi: Attack: 14 Damage: 4 and misses. The South one attacks Fjolnir again: Attack: 10 Damage: 7 and also misses. After the spiders attack, and miss, they both disappear. Fjolnir, Hymir and Az Emberi are up.

Cure wounds on Absinthe. 11 Ba shift Perception 16 Adv. 8
"Fjolnir jumps out of the hallway and backs over to Dustfinger, pulling the cap off a health potion and handing it toward him- 'Bottoms up!' Bonus action hunters mark for whenever these nasties show back up."
Run up to the party and do perception to try and find them 4 Ready an action firebolt the first enemy I see and position my self looking down the hallway Hit 21 damage 5
"Fjolnir hands off a potion to Dustfinger, (Make sure to mark that on your sheets. Also, you can't technically hold a bonus action, only full actions. Bonus actions and movement must be done on your turn, the exception is holding a dash action. You can edit you post if you'd like.) Hymir readies firebolt for anything that appears in the hall, but try as he may, he can't see anything. Az Emberi heals Absinthe up a bit, and cannot see or smell or hear any sign of the spiders. It's almost like they are not even on this plane of existence currently. Dirk, Dustfinger and Absinthe are up. Phase Spiders: Round 2 23- Dirk 22- Dustfinger (5/27 HP, Mirror Image) 17- Absinthe (14/35 HP) 16- Phase Spiders 1) Taken 17 damage, Looks hurt (Disappeared) 2) (Disappeared) 14- Fjolnir (28/44 HP) 14- Hymir (Readying attack action) 8- Az Emberi"
Move to Absinthe and cast lvl 2 cure wounds on him. 12
"Feeling a bit refreshed, Absinthe moves South 10ft and West 20ft. Save for Attack if I see anything around the corner."
"Dustybutt pockets the potion and reaffirms his grip on life by reaffirming his grip on his instrument of self-preservation, waiting for the spiders to return. (Hold action until a spider appears, then we shank his ass.)"
"Dirk gives Absinthe a bit of healing. Dustfinger stands ready. Absinthe tries to get ahead and punch something, but the webbing proves difficult to move through. He holds his attack as well. The two spiders reappear, one behind Dustfinger and one between Absinthe and Fjolnir, but before they get to strike, Dustfinger, Absinthe and Hymir release their readied actions. Absinthe slashes at the one that appeared behind him: Attack: 20 Damage: 7 and makes a small gash across it's backside. Dustfinger's flourishing attack slices off a mandible. Hymir's Firebolt chars a section of exoskeleton. The first spider attacks Dustfinger: Attack: 19 Damage: 11 / 8 But hits and destroys one of his duplicates. It then runs around to the other side of the pit. (Dustfinger used his reaction to use his held action, so no opportunity.) The second attacks Fjolnir: Attack: 21 Damage: 11 piercing, and Fjolnir must make a DC 11 CON Save or take 14 poison damage. (Then apply poison resistance again. I did not add any of the damage to your sheet yet.) A third phase spider runs out of a doorway in the hall, across the webs, bites at Absinthe, then phases out of the material plane. Attack: 10 Damage: 10 But in its haste it misses. Fjolnir must make his CON Save, then take his turn, and Hymir and Az Emberi are up.  Phase Spiders: Round 2 23- Dirk 22- Dustfinger (5/27 HP, 2 Mirror Image copies) 17- Absinthe (26/35 HP) 16- Phase Spiders 1) Taken 26 damage, Looks rough 2) Taken 12 damage 3) (Disappeared) 14- Fjolnir (28/44 HP) 14- Hymir 8- Az Emberi"
"Dustfinger spins, trying to slash across this things face. 26 Damage 9"
I move into the hallway to the spider and ba cast flame blade. I swing at it 14 dmg. 10
"Con save: 22 Fjolnir focuses his hunters' mark on the spider, and produces Hew and a Scimitar, barking unintelligible Dwarvish at the creature. Hew att 21 dmg 3 Scimitar att 14 dmg 8 Hunters mark 1"
Figuring that my teammates will make quick work of the hurt spider I run over and attack the other spider with a fire chromatic orb Hit 23 fire damage 8
"I cup check Dustfinger sternly with an L1 cure wounds 9  I persuade the chat into thinking that I was not manipulating the dice at all, and that they are very natural rolls with natural results. 24"
"Dustfinger begins his incantation for toll the dead, waiting the reappearance of the third spider. Wis save vs 14 or take 1 damage, or if already damaged take 3"
"'Today you die, Blinky! Short sword Attack: 14 Damage: 6 Punch to spider Butt Attack: 23 Damage: 8"
"Fjolnir strikes with two weapons and hits with both. (While Hew can be used one-handed, it doesn't have the 'light' property and cannot be used in conjunction with another weapon for dual wielding. A dagger can, however, so we'll just assume you did that with a dagger/scimitar. Also, you don't add the bonus damage to the bonus attack unless you have a feat or fighting style for it, so your total damage would be 10 + 6 , because you roll Hunter's Mark damage on every hit.) Hymir casts a sphere of flame at the spider near the pit and burns a hole right through it. It falls to the ground. Az Emberi conjures a blade of flame and slices through the spider in the hallway's face. It also falls to the ground. As far as the chat is concerned, Dirk has never manipulated a dice roll in his life. Pondering this fact, Dustfinger is caught off guard by a cup check, that immediately starts to feel better through the magic of healing. Dustfinger holds a Toll the Dead spell at the ready for any spider that appears in the room. Absinthe stands ready to strike with his sword. The phase spider pops up in the same spot it disappeared, right next to Absinthe in the hall. This unfortunately means Dustfinger's spell doesn't cast, but Absinthe slashes at its legs as it bites at him, severing one, which completely throws the creature off its attack. (Your modifier for the sword damage is +4, and your unarmed is +3, but you can only hold the action so the Butt Punch attack didn't happen) Spider Bite: Attack: 5 Damage: 5 The spider retreats into a side doorway about 10' behind it. (Absinthe does not get an opportunity attack because it takes your reaction to spend your held action) Fjolnir, Hymir and Az Emberi are up . Phase Spiders: Round 3 23- Dirk 22- Dustfinger (14/27 HP, 2 Mirror Image copies) 17- Absinthe (26/35 HP) 16- Phase Spiders 1) Dead 2) Dead 3) Taken 5 damage, in side room 14- Fjolnir (13/44 HP) 14- Hymir 8- Az Emberi"
I chase the spider down burning webs along the way I dash to the door ot went in
i run over and give Fjolnir a health potion 6
"Fjolnir throws back the heal potion and shakes his head tossing droplets away from his beard, and readies an attack for the moment the critter reappears."
"Fjolnir nocks an arrow and waits. Hymir shoves a potion down his throat. Az Emberi continues slashing away at webs on his way to fight the spider. He makes it through 15' of webs and stands next to Absinthe. The burning blade makes the sticky web on the floor recoil back, clearing the floor. He notices as he's walking, now that some of the wall is visible, similar slits in the wall to the hallway with the pendulum blade traps, and he puckers momentarily because he was in the pathway of one before he noticed it, but there was no sound of grinding gears or anything to suppose that the trap was still active. He continues another 15' to just inside the doorway on the North of the hall, illuminating the room and revealing the hiding spider. Dirk, Dustfinger and Absinthe are up! Phase Spiders: Round 3 23- Dirk 22- Dustfinger (14/27 HP, 2 Mirror Image copies) 17- Absinthe (26/35 HP) 16- Phase Spiders 1) Dead 2) Dead 3) Taken 5 damage, in side room 14- Fjolnir (19/44 HP) 14- Hymir 8- Az Emberi"
"Dustfinger's breath catches as he locks eyes with the cup-checking Dirk. A universe is born between them, galaxies of emotion swirling into existence. Strange new mysteries fill the void between the known stars of feeling, and new realizations form. 'Sorry, you're not my type.' Dustfinger moves to the door way to join the group in the hall, and readies another round of toll the dead. Wis Save vs 14, 1 damage if you suck."
Absinthe continues forward slashing through the spider web another 10ft to the opening of the side room. (Once I can see what is around the corner I will continue with the rest of my movement and turn.)
I yell 'more ****ing traps watch your step'
"Perception 11 of A universe being born between them, galaxies of emotion swirling into existence. Strange new mysteries filling the void between the known stars of feeling. Dirk probably doesn't see this. Huh? I cup check him harder. 11 l1 cure wounds"
"Dirk does indeed fail to see Dustfinger's swirling emotions, but cup checks a healing Cure Wounds to his nethers once again. A rush of healing energy flows into the warlock and the pain only lasts for a split second. He feels nearly in top shape now. Dustfinger then moves into the hallway to get a better view of the action and holds a weak ass bell toll. Metallica he is not. Absinthe bounds through the hall, past Az Emberi and into the spider's face. This room is thick with webs. Where the hallway simply made movement slower and obscured vision, this room is most assuredly a nest. The sticky webs cover every surface and are thick enough to make the large room feel cramped. He swings his sword and follows up with a punch from his other hand. Attack: 26 Damage: 6 Attack: 19 Damage: 4 The sword cuts deep into the spider's face which makes the creature recoil out of the way of the incoming punch. The spider bites at Absinthe then disappears. Attack: 20 Damage: 10 It misses but is now gone. Fjolnir, Hymir and Az Emberi are up.  Phase Spiders: Round 4 23- Dirk 22- Dustfinger (25/27 HP, 2 Mirror Image copies) 17- Absinthe (26/35 HP) 16- Phase Spider (Taken 16 damage) 14- Fjolnir (19/44 HP) 14- Hymir 8- Az Emberi"
"Fjolnir jogs forward up to the doorway, spitting spider webs off his beard all the way. '...pffff... leggy chitinous shit!' Spying the critter, he moves his mark to it, cants his long bow and sails an arrow past Absinthe at it. Longbow 24 Dmg 5 Hunters Mark 4"
I carefully follow Az moving through the webs I use the misleading named dash action to carefully move mor distance
If it isnt dead or phased I swing at it again 15 dmg. 10
"Fjolnir moves just outside the door and holds an arrow to anything that would appear in the room. Hymir moves through the path cleared be Az Emberi, then slips past him into the web-filled room. Az Emberi readies himself to swing at the thing if it appears again.  Dirk, Dustfinger and Absinthe are up. Phase Spiders: Round 4 23- Dirk 22- Dustfinger (25/27 HP, 2 Mirror Image copies) 17- Absinthe (26/35 HP) 16- Phase Spider (Taken 16 damage) 14- Fjolnir (19/44 HP) 14- Hymir 8- Az Emberi"
"Dustfinger reluctantly salutes Dirk for the gratuitous testicle swathing and bolts down the hall, screaming. 'TOLL THE DEAD, TOLL THE DEAD!' Dustfinger is eager to toll the dead, and waits to toll the dead. Save vs Wis 14 or take 7 damage"
"Dirk yawns. On the one hand, a spider that can disappear is the stuff of nightmares. On the other, I've never been more bored in my life. If only spiders were smart enough to know they were going to die, and just die already..... Midget lovers. Pulls crossbow and readies another miss for the team. Attack: 13 Damage: 7"
"'Quit running away you rancid mouth fart!' Absinthe bbegins hacking at the web in anger, holding an attack in case it phases back."
"While Dirk waits in the previous room in case it shows back up in there, Dustfinger runs down the hall screaming and Absinthe hopes the spider will appear right in front of him so he can punch it. It does not appear right in front of him, it actually appears in the hallway behind Fjolnir and Dustfinger. The two of them, plus Az Emberi through the doorway, unleash their held attacks. Az Emberi's flaming sword burns through into its flesh, and it screams. Fjolnir is forced to fire at it adjacently, (giving disadvantage) 15 but still drives an arrow into its hide. Dustfinger finally gets to toll the bell, 4 and the spider's head rings with sounds of its own demise. It crumples to the ground and turns a pale gray. It is now eerily quiet. The map so far:"
I go to work slowly clearing the room of spider webs and searching for interesting things and traps.
I could use a good long rest once we've secured the area. Perception 9 . +2
'Absinthe seconds long rest.'
I pick up the torch I lit before the battle with mage hand and start clearing out webs while using my passive investigation to look for treasure and traps
... Did you just refer to yourself in third person Absinthe?
"Everyone pitches in to clear the webs. It takes quite a while, but in the process, you realize the webs have been piled upon themselves for years, and there are many layers, some of which holding skeletal remains that have been forgotten and covered once there was no more meat to be gained from the carcass. Some of them appear to have been humanoid, and some of those were carrying items that survived the ages. After the room is finally cleared there appear to be no traps in the spider's nest, and the three new blade traps you find in the hallway are deactivated. You also get a look into the adjacent hallways, but there is nothing of interest in either location. 73 98 In total, you find on all the scattered corpses: (adding all gold and gems to party loot) 20 X100 (2,000) CP, 9 X100 (1,100) SP, 7 X10 (60) GP, 6 10GP Gems, and 3 other items. 38 2 Potions. One potion looks very similar to a healing potion, but, bigger. (Potion of Superior Healing) The other potion has a mix of red and clear liquid. The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process."
"(since someone is shaking it, I've decided that is me) Guys, this... might be past the expiration date. I think it might be peck de-greaser. What the hell, I try to figure out what it is. 17 + a modifier that is likely 1 or 2. I of course share my thoughts with everyone. 2"
"'KLADOS!' Dustfinger roars, joining then spreading his index fingers apart from each other, splitting into four Dustfingers. Dustfinger tries to recall anything he might know about specters such as these, and relays to the team anything that's advantageous. Check (add 1 if straight Int check, or add 3 if you think Arcana is appropriate) 11"
"Arcana or History check (same mod) 25 Alright gents these creatures have weathered the test of times as well as the elements try and find a way to hit them with with non specific magic, and Dirk you aren't going to be able to charm a way into their ghostly britches isn't that right other Hymir... Yep' (I clearly said that entire sentence i didn't use different voices or talk through the side of my mouth to indicate a separate person, i just outright asked myself for confirmation and answered it normally) magic missiles lvl 2 all on the ghost to the right which is closest to me 10"
"'*spits *sigh the hell, man..?!' Fjolnir concentrates on the right ghost and marks him as quarry- bounds over to beside Absinthe and sails an arrow at the figure. Longbow 13 dmg 11 Hunters' Mark 2"
"Hymir blasts the one on the right with a Magic Missile barrage just after explaining to the party how they should try to hurt them. Fjolnir has a clear shot at the same ghost and fires an arrow. The arrow goes through it but causes the form to ripple a little from the piercing damage. Dustfinger didn't remember more than Hymir had said about the ghosts, which he was thankful for, and he then cast Mirror Image on himself to help with the incoming beating. Dirk, Absinthe, Az Emberi, you're up! Round 1: Ghost Guards 23- Hymir 17- Fjolnir (Hunter's Mark on #2) 14- Dustfinger (Mirror Image: 3 copies) 7- Dirk (Invisible) 5- Absinthe 4- Az Emberi 4- Ghosts 1) 2) Taken 16 damage"
"I don't know what you mean by non specific magic? Are saying use magic or not!? Turning my attention to the ghostly entity on the left. I don't know if you died and lost your body or if you mattered so little in life that you just faded into an over rated alarm clock. You are as useless now as you ever were and your mom is proud because even now you far exceeded anyone's expectations in life, and death. Vicious mockery 2 Bardic inspiration to Hymir You can do it, I have a shred of faith in you reserved for this very moment."

"Dirk slings vicious insults at one of the ghosts. WIS Save: 11 The ghost is visibly upset. Absinthe slices through the ghost with his sword which makes it wince with pain but its ethereal form repairs itself. The punch connects but doesn't have the impact that punches usually do. Az Emberi goes wolfy and brings down a radiant beam of light on the ghost. CON Save: 14 It resists the brunt of it but is still shaken, and its form is not held together quite as well anymore. The ghost on the left slowly floats to the edge of the top level. It then contorts its face into a Horrifying Visage, accompanied by a loud scream. The scream / visage combo is enough to make you want to run away. Everyone must make a WIS Save DC 13 or be Frightened . (A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.) The ghost on the right looks into Absinthe's soul. A sickly smile comes across its lips, and it reaches its hand inside Absinthe's chest cavity. Absinthe must also make a CHA Save DC 13 , then the ghost will finish its turn.

"Everyone manages to fight through the fear of the visage with the exception of Absinthe and Dustfinger. Unfortunately, the two of you also feel your bodies aging rapidly as you fast forward through years of life. (You failed so hard, the effects of the Horrifying Visage also ages you 3 X10 years. Sorry, but this is why I didn't want to roll it for you. I'll edit your sheets. So mechanically this doesn't mean anything, but if you continually gain aging effects and age past your races life expectancy, you could outright die of natural causes, the worst way for an adventurer to go.) You can make another WIS Save at the end of your turn to try and shake the frightened condition. Absinthe, being frightened by one of the ghosts, refused to allow the other to hold sway over him and forced it out of his chest. The creature hissed and recoiled, readying the next strike.

Fjolnir unfortunately misses his shot and curses under his breath about sphincters or something. Dustfinger thinks he hits with an eldritch blast, but it looks like he just hit between its arm and torso. After that, he realizes he has faced his fear and overcome it! Dirk insults the other one this time, for some effect. Absinthe focuses his rage on the one in front of him. With a solid hit from his sword and two connections with his fists, the ghost dissipates and fades into the ether. Az Emberi moves the moonbeam to the other ghost. 10 It starts burning in the light.

"Everyone, including Az Emberi, watches in horror as the ghost disappears inside of Az Emberi's body. Az's thoughts and vision are still his own, but his actions belong to the spirit now and he must bear silent witness to what the ghost is doing without the ability to stop it. Az turns to face Dustfinger, palming his already magical shillelagh with an evil grin on his face. Hymir, Fjolnir and Dustfinger are up."
Wisdom save: 11
Everyone back up Az Emberi is strong enough to fight this off stay at the ready even if he attacks give him a chance to exercise this spirit himself I move back 6 spaces to get out of his reach (of I need to move a couple more I will dash but I just want to be out of reach not to far away)

You're an idiot and we dont even know what you are 20% of the time you are only weakening Az by attacking him and lowering our chances of success if you attack him again I will end you. I obviously have a plan and foresee him getting out of this so there is no need to attack full force before he even gets 1 chance to break free in which if or when he does it would have done no negative affect to the group instead you just did a negative affect to the group.
"Hymir warns everyone to back off and let Az Emberi fight the ghost off, then proceeds to back off and let Az Emberi fight the ghost off, unaware that Az Emberi is unable to fight the ghost off, no matter how hard everyone backs off. Fjolnir rushes to try and at least keep him from doing too much damage, 10 and succeeds in holding him still. Dustfinger blunt-edges the wolf-man to significant effect with his Toby/Toby. Hymir chastizes Dustfinger for hitting a party member, but in hindsight, he probably thought that Az Emberi had another chance to fight the ghost off if they had just backed off, which he does not, so... you know.

Absinthe also thinks this same owlbear has come back to life and proceeds to start putting it down again. His sword hits but the punch he threw glanced off the butt. Dirk fires off a beam of bright light from his new toy. 9 The owlbear recoils and tries to shield its eyes, but it's too late. It peers around trying to figure out what happened but is now blinded... by the light... Leaping out of hiding, especially now since the owlbear can't see him anyway, Az Emberi creates a fiery blade in his hand and moves in to strike the creature, leaving singed hair and flesh on the side of its face. The owlbear bites and claws at where it thinks Dirk is and its sense of smell proves efficient enough to land a decent chomp to his leg, although the claw narrowly misses.

"Az Emberi's action, though it obliterates one of the tiny beasts, reveals his location to the others. Fjolnir lets two arrows fly upward. One sticks right through an eye socket and the other through a different one's chest. Both creatures stop flying and continue their trajectory right into the ground at Fjolnir's feet. The remaining seven stirges split up now that Az Emberi is a visible target.

You could use it to take a dash action and get to them, but not do anything else, so I figured you wouldn't want to waste it.) Dirk manages to put the three stirges to sleep, and not Az Emebri.

Hymir gets back into the South hallway. Dirk does the same thing to skeleton #6 from the North with his crossbow. It hits and some bone fragments fracture off of it. He too gets back into cover. Absinthe knows he is too far away to effectively finish off #6 with a dart, so he peeks his head back into the room to see if any of them are closer, and in doing so, the remaining skeletons release their held arrows. Attack: 5 Damage: 5 Attack: 24 Damage: 10 Attack: 19 Damage: 5 Two arrows strike him for a total of 15 damage, but he whips his dart at #3, cracking its skull and any semblence of life it had left. Absinthe gets back behind the wall for safety. 3 skeletons remain. Skeletons #1 and 6 line up with the doorway and each tries to put arrows through it, into Dustfinger. Attack: 17 Damage: 7 Attack: 10 Damage: 4 One succeeds and sticks him in the leg, the other doesn't even make it through the door. The third skeleton doesn't have a good shot on anyone and doesn't attempt to do so. (I have applied all damage applicable. Absinthe , if you want to use your Shrug Damage feature, go ahead and roll for it. Max you can reduce is 10.)

Attack: 20 Damage: 7 Vines shoot out from Az Emberi's hands and wrap around the skeleton pulling it toward Az, the thorns of the vine and on the ground tearing its bones up. It's not dead but it's close. Round 3 Fjolnir pulls another 'Robin Hood' shot and releases 2 arrows at once, both hitting their intended target. Skeleton #6 crumbles to make way for the other arrow to hit #1, who is now missing its ribcage... Which is actually rather unfortunate since Dustfinger was right behind him with an Eldritch Blast that would've made a wonderful combo attack, but the missing ribs caused the shot to miss and hit the back wall.

"What should've been a finishing move for the party ended up being an utter failure, as Hymir, Dirk and Absinthe all miss their targets. Hymir had too much to get around and misjudged the shot, as did Dirk. Absinthe moved past Az Emebri into the room, skirting around the spikes, and flung a dart that just barely missed.

"Fjolnir's arrow just barely wedges itself into a fold in the bugbear's armor, and it cries out again. It races away from the pair of combatants, and as soon as it steps into the fungal carpeted cavern, multiple plants spew forth a gaseous cloud, instantly filling the room. 8 The tall creature gags, coughs, and vomits but continues running through the cloud around a corner out of sight. He looks rough before he gets out of sight, but in order to get a line of sight you'll need to enter the cloud."
I rear back and halt immediately.
"**** your clouds bitch! I charge through, not quite aware how much this is a bad idea. 10"
"Dustfinger wonders what the rush is and shrugs to himself. 'Whelp...' He picks the box back up and stows it somewhere on his person and rushes off to rejoin the crew... in his mind. But given the thing is so damn bulky, he decides just to hang out here and try to pick its lock. Thieves Tools 8"
"Dusty whispers to the rest of the team. 'The tunnels connect. Dirk is mostly likely going to stir attention to the north, whether he wants it or not. We should get people with him, and on the west entry, to box them in. Spikes on one opening, do we have a barrier maker for the other?' He heads west, as he was doing before."
"Fjolnir slaps his face, sighs, and rubs his nose and eye, before dragging his hand away disheveling his moustache. He hikes his belt up and heads out to the mouth of the discovered room to cover Dirk and Absinthe, palming a few arrows on the way."
"Throwing stealth out the window, Dirk makes himself a distraction. Dustfinger proposes a plan and heads off the long way around. Dirk and Absinthe hear hissing and growling from the West side of the cavern. It is a sound you've heard before, ghouls! They start coming into Dirk's vision down the stairs and pouring off the cliff. Fjolnir follows Dirk and Absinthe. Initiatives Absinthe: 10 Az Emberi: 6 Dirk: 14 Dustfinger: 13 Hymir: 17 Fjolnir: 11 Ghouls: 17 Upon seeing the source of the noise (a delicious looking snake-man) the ghouls charge forward with nothing but frothing hunger on their faces. You can tell it has been a long time since they have eaten. Some of them get close enough to strike. Attack: 7 Damage: 5 Attack: 10 Damage: 10 ...but both of them miss.

"Faerie fire covering the south to the north zombie, should only exclude one. Pretty violet shits. 12 Dexterity save ... Oh shit."
Az Emberi would have followed Dirk to the room. When he sees Dirk dive into the skeletons his jaw drops open for an extremely long moment. He then rolls all three eyes and squares his shoulders for combat.
"Dustfinger hearing the commotion has started already, understands that he understood nothing, and turns back around, dashing to catch up with the group in the north-going tunnel."
"Hymir, who also stayed with the group due to his inability to see in the dark, pushes past them as soon as he hears Dirk fighting a corpse and the hissing creatures that follow, and feels around until he thinks he's in the open cavern. Someone, light 'em up! He then readies a shatter spell to trigger as soon as he can see. At that point, Dirk casts Faerie Fire encasing most of them in purple light, hoping it will stick to some of them at least, but unfortunately catching himself in the spell's effect. DEX Saves: 11 / 15 / 9 / 6 / 3 / 11 Only 1 Ghoul in the area is able to dodge the clinging light, the rest now emit dim light in a 10' radius, which is enough for Hymir's Shatter spell to have a decent target. He carefully picks the target point to include 6 ghouls but not get Dirk in the area. Shatter: 17 Thunder damage. A loud crack echoes through the cavern. CON Saves: 5 / 14 / 4 / 16 / 19 / 13 Most of them are able to withstand the devastating attack, but a couple of them now look close to falling apart.

I mobe north 4 squares and cast spike growth on the spot that keeps dirk just out if the radius.
"'Right, time for the punching to start!' Absinthe shouts at he releases the rope holding his robe closed and drops everything but his sword to the ground. 'I will pound you to mush and use you as filling for my next pie! Or something like that!' Absinthe charges towards the closest ghoul. Short sword Attack: 18 Damage: 5 Punch to face Attack: 17 Damage: 7"
"He squints an eye and distances one of the rotting animations away from Dirk, whispers to the fletching of an arrow and sets a Hail of Thorns conjuration on it- he sails the arrow at the middle-of-the-pack creature, and nocks and looses a second at the one immediately to it's South. Longbow 25 7 Hail of Thorns Hordebreaker 26 7"
"Round 1 Fjolnir is on his game. He whispers his incantation and releases two arrows. They hit both their targets in the chest. The primary target dies, but before he even falls to the ground, his chest explodes with thorns and the three adjacent ghouls try to shield themselves. DEX Saves: 3 / 7 / 4 against 8 piercing damage. None of them are able to react quick enough, and the thorns finish off the other arrow recipient. Absinthe gets excited for smashing things into pie-paste, and rushes into battle in his full battle attire. He is able to move 30', just East of Dirk, punch #5 in the face with his shortsword, then follow up with a devastating skull-cruncher. It's not dead, but it's close. Az Emberi locks down the battlefield with his signature Spike Growth. Sharp spikes grow from the floor around the ghouls' feet and make their paths deadly.  Round 2 Ghoul #1 cares not about the spikes, its ravenous hunger the only thing on its mind. It charges 20' directly at Dirk, shredding itself for 25 piercing damage. It gets adjacent to Dirk as it swings a claw at nothing and perishes. Ghoul #2 had already clambered atop a table and the spikes do not reach him. He jumps off the other end of it and attacks Absinthe. Attack: 22 Damage: 11 (Damage already applied, you must make a CON Save, DC 10 ) Ghoul #3 takes one step toward Dirk 8 and dies in the spikes.

"You all do what settling you can in this cramped but easily defensible room. Dustfinger takes the first watch after everyone goes to sleep. Make a perception check, you have to beat a 2 .

"Initiative 18 'WAKE UP! WE'VE GOT A BLOBLEM!' Dustfinger backs up the far end of the room away from the ooze. He raises one hand up in the air, palm to heaven, absorbing energy from the atmosphere.

Electricity dances back and forth across the large sentient puddle and instead of doing anything negative to it, the ooze seems invigorated. It splits apart into two medium-sized oozes and continues forward. Each jelly now moves independently of the other, one schlorps over to Absinthe, the other shlobbles at Fjolnir. Both of you are prone still, so they strike at advantage: Vs. Absinthe: Attack: 13 Damage: 9 Absinthe is awake enough to roll to the side and avoid the pseudopod strike. Vs.

"(Gak TM ) Round 1: Deadly Marmalade! Fjolnir uses Hew and, as is its namesake, the blade cuts the jelly into two equal parts. It is akin to cutting flan if the flan then moved on its own. No part of the ooze seems to be lost in this process, and out of each one extrudes a pseudopod, ready to strike. Dirk gets stabby with one of the two small-sized ones, and pierces it enough for it to stop moving. It flows out akin to melted flan and puddles on the floor. Dustfinger blasts the other small one, making up for his lack of damage in the surprise round and forces it within an inch of its life. It's akin to hitting flan with an Eldritch Blast. Az Emberi focuses magical essence into his club and beats the Ochre jelly once with a solid swing. It splatters across the floor in what could be considered a grand slam. It's akin to hitting flan with a club. Hymir stands up and shoots a firebolt at the medium one. Attack: 22 Damage: 9 A solid hit! It's akin to flan en flambe'. The flan- er, Ochre Jelly, stirkes again at Absinthe who is still prone. Attack: 22 Damage: 13 Bludeoning damage, and an additional 4 acid. It's akin to being slapped in the face by an acidic flan.

"(I just placed you in the order of your stealth rolls) You break down your crowded camp, even more so with the acidic puddles, and quietly exit the storeroom. You make your way West to the door you passed while exploring earlier. Another wave crashes with a loud boom. Quietly, Dirk tries the door, it's not locked, and surprisingly, opens smoothly and with no noise. Old stone bunks in orderly rows line the walls of this chamber, and a corroded iron brazier full of old coals stands near the middle of the room. The bones of a half dozen dwarves and orcs lie strewn about, clad in scraps of armor. Three gray, hunched ghouls squat among the remains, pawing at the scraps and gnawing on the bones. Before you can act, Fjolnir makes an accidental scuffing noise with his boot on the smooth stone floor. The three ghouls immediately look up from their meager pickings and start slavering and screeching at their new meal.

As soon as the arrows fly Absinthe bounds past as only a naked goliath can, dashing with Step of the Wind around his allies into the fray. (I marked your ki point for your dash bonus action. It actually took 65' to get around the group and through Dirk's space, but you have 80' if you dash, so no worries) His initial stab misses but the groin kick connects and lifts the ghoul off the ground a few inches. Whatever semblance of genitals it once had are long gone, so it just stares hungrily at the big man. Az Emberi has to move into an open space to get a visual, but he flings a magic stone past Dirk at one of them, hitting it in the chest. A crack is heard, and that ghoul looks hurt. Dustfinger wells up with anger. He channels his anger into a vile beam of energy and directs it past Dirk into the room at the right-most ghoul, all while cursing angrily. It is the angriest blast of eldritch energy any of you have ever seen. It singes the ghoul's arm a little bit. Dirk, for being the one to open the door, has the slowest reaction to the ghouls of the party. Nonetheless, he strikes the right ghoul with a bolt square in the chest, dropping him into a lifeless heap on the ground. The ghouls claw at the closest meat available, namely Absinthe.

You see an area just South of your current location that has traces of what appears to be acid damage to the walls, as well as a half-dissolved skeleton, and deduce this dead-end hallway must've been the lair of the Ochre Jelly.

"Yup, that's acid alright... you move on. You continue carefully and quietly exploring the maze-like tunnels amid the sound of booming wave crashes, finding a few more dead ends with nothing of note until the last way to go is the natural tunnel that reaches from where you first entered the cave. After signaling the rest of the group that the coast is clear, you press forward. The tunnel leads on about 50 more feet and opens up to a natural cave. A still pool fills much of this cavern. The water is dark, revealing little of what might lie within. The shore of the pool consists of a thin layer of broken shells from strange, pale mussels, and a fishy odor hangs in the air. You can see a stairway leading up on the East side of the cavern. From the North, you hear faintly trickling water."
Survival check on water. 17
"Getting closer to the water you notice the trickling sound is most likely coming from where the water exits the cavern at the North end. It looks like a tunnel opening that rises 2-3 feet from the surface of the water, enough to not have to submerge to fully to get through it. The water seems like it should be ok for consumption. There is what appears to be a humanoid shape about 10' out from the edge of the pool, maybe in about 10' deep water."

Absinthe charges towards the one closest to the door to let loose an ass whooping! Short sword Attack: 17 Damage: 10 Punch to chest Attack: 8 Damage: 7 Ki point kick to head Attack: 21 Damage: 6"
"As soon as the door opens, before anyone else can act, Hymir starts counting, 'One, two, three, I can get four of them, Hymir! Excellent, other Hymir!' and then whispers an incantation while holding his arcane focus orb. He snaps his fingers, and in that instant, a sudden, painfully intense ringing noise emanates from the brazier. It shatters, sending loose coals spilling to the floor, and wracking four of the bugbears for 10 thunder damage. CON Saves: 14 / 6 / 5 / 14 (The Big Guy and #4 take half damage) Fjolnir's arrows both strike true, the first splintering and shooting outward like a magical shrapnel bomb. DEX Saves: 21 / 9 / 5 (The Big Guy takes half damage) Absinthe does as he does and stabs the closest bugbear in the shoulder, it pulls back causing him to miss with his follow up punch, but it doesn't dodge the roundhouse to the head, which staggers the 7' tall goblinoid, not only because Absinthe had to do sideways splits to get his leg that high. The Big Guy yells in goblin: 'Get them!' and all five of them charge Absinthe with morningstars swinging, forming a semi-circle of beatdown around him. Attack: 19 Damage: 10 The Big Guy hits. Attack: 9 Damage: 10 miss Attack: 6 Damage: 14 miss Attack: 6 Damage: 13 miss Attack: 16 Damage: 8 #4 hits. All damage applied.

"I move next to Absinthe and cast L1 cure wounds on the naked behemoth, carefully. 7"
"Having adventured with Az long enough, Dustfinger assumes some kind of nuke is about to go off and tries to creatively rescue Absinthe. He backs up five feet, while electricity arcs from his elbow down to his hand as he mutters his incantation, and he flings it out like a whip to snare the goliath and pull him away from the bugbear bukakke. The lightning loops around Absinthe and Dustfinger pulls, trying to reel him in to just in front of Fjolnir. Then Dustfinger Hexes the center bugbear in the back of the formation. (I've backed up 5' so Absinthe doesn't end up next to me to trigger damage. I don't know if he has to make a saving throw or if he can elect to fail it, but it's Strength vs 14. Hex is hexing Dex.)"
Az Emberi claps his hands together rubbing them vigourously. He breaths into the space between his hands and the breath is visible as if it's many degrees colder in the room than it is. He parts his hands and creates a shard of ice. He flings it at center back bugbear Atk 21 Dmg 4 piercing. He and everyone adjacent to him must beat a dex save of 14 or take 6 cold dmg.
"Round 1: Bug-Barracks Light: Dim light from the shattered brazier Dustfinger steps back and pulls Absinthe out of future harm's way with a lasso made of lightning. (I assume you're letting that happen and not trying to save.) Then he hexes #2. Dirk puts a hand on Absinthe through the doorway and heals him. Az Emberi successfully strikes the bugbear in the middle with an Ice Shard that explodes into smaller ice shards! All the bugbears try to shield themselves. DEX Saves: 22 / 5 / 17 / 10 / 22 #1 and #3 are the only ones who don't shield themselves in time. #1 pays the ultimate price for his slow reaction time. Round 2, begins! Hymir, Fjolnir and Absinthe, you're up! 23: Hymir 13: Fjolnir 11: Absinthe 11: Bugbears Big Guy) Taken 15 damage (Looks hurt) 1) Dead 2) Taken 20 damage (Looks hurt) Hexxed (DEX) 3) Taken 22 damage (Looks rough) 4) Taken 5 damage 08: Dustfinger (C) on Hex 04: Dirk 04: Az Emberi"
"Peering over the shielding of his forearm from the arcing and spray of ice, Fjolnir sputters in frustration, 'Still not dead?!' He whispers another Hail of Thorns conjuration on an arrow, punctuated by a myriad of colloquialisms referring to dwarven genitals, and arrows split the air toward Bugbear 2 and then 4. Longbow 9 Dmg 5 Hail of Thorns 1 Hordebreaker 22 Dmg 4"
Absinthe let's a fart squeek out as appreciation for the healing. 'You goblin molesting bugbear are at an end!' Short sword Attack: 22 Damage: 8 Bitch slap to face Attack: 16 Damage: 4 Ki point kick to the plums Attack: 15 Damage: 4
"Hymir pushes past the rest of the party into the room, trying to give the bugbears another target than just Absinthe. He places his thumbs together and fans out his fingers at the bugbears and a cone of flame envelopes them all for 7 fire damage. DEX Saves: 17 / 4 / 8 / 4 The Big Guy continues to be adept at dodging full damage. #2 and #3 drop dead, #4's hair is singed in places. Fjolnir was aiming at #2, but since it died he shot an arrow at #4. It unfortunately misses. (Since they died before your turn came up, there is nothing within 5' of each other, so the Hordebreaker is negated, and I'll let you take back the casting of Hail of Thorns if you'd like since they aren't adjacent anymore.) Absinthe takes a step forward and hits the Big Guy with his sword, taking him within an inch of his life. Then he squashes that inch with a resounding bitch slap to the face. The Big Guy goes down. Absinthe turns his attention to #4's plums, but his kick is blocked by a shield. The bugbear retaliates by swinging his morningstar Attack: 17 Damage: 9 He hits and stands his ground in front of the goliath, having nowhere else to go. Round 2: Bug-Barracks Light: Dim light from the shattered brazier Dustfinger, Dirk and Az Emberi are up. 23: Hymir 13: Fjolnir 11: Absinthe 11: Bugbears Big Guy) Dead 2) Dead 3) Dead 4) Taken 12 damage 08: Dustfinger (C) on Hex 04: Dirk 04: Az Emberi"
"Dustfinger orients his hex on the last remaining bugbar, and lobs a blob of mystical energy at his head. 'On your left, ON YOUR LEFT!' Eldritch Blast 25 Dam 3 plus 5 from Hex"
"I run up and kick him in the testicles Attack: 6 Damage: [roll](if([roll:-1:critical], =0, 1d4, 2{1d4}.expand()))+1.... well the damage is supposed to be a 1 anyway."
I get up to him. 'Hey would you want to surrender and answer some questions by any chance' Wait half a second for his unfavorable response. Ba shillelagh and clober him across the dome non lethal Atk. 8 Dmg. 6
"Dustfinger blasts the bugbear for a decent amount with his additional hex bonus. Dirk and Az Emberi both miss the last one after he shows no interest in surrendering. Round 3! Hymir, Fjolnir and Absinthe are up again! 23: Hymir 13: Fjolnir 11: Absinthe 11: Bugbear 4) Taken 20 damage, looks hurt 08: Dustfinger (C) on Hex 04: Dirk 04: Az Emberi"
'Why does no one want to surrender and have a chat?!' Fjolnir produces another arrow and looses it at the 7' tall fly magnet. Longbow 20 Dmg 6
"Hymir blasts the bugbear with a fire bolt Attack: 18 Damage: 6 Hitting it in the face. It staggers but remains standing (barely). Fjolnir finishes it off with a solid center mass shot, hitting just to the side of the sternum for a perfect heart attack. Combat is over."
"Dustfinger moves to the door to the east, thinking it might lead out to the center hall. He opens it carefully."
"I follow Dustfinger, with caution Stealth 8 Perception 7"
"That door is barricaded with broken furniture, you begin moving things out of the way as quietly as you can. What are the rest of you doing?"
Fjolnir enters the room and picks up an unspent arrow. He continues to scan around the room and under the bunks for anything useful.
Absinthe assists with the moving of furniture blocking the door.
"Az Emberi checks for life among the Bugbears 24 One by one, looking for a heartbeat, he finds nothing. He calls their deaths out citing the time of day. On the Big Guy's belt, there is a pouch containing 15 cp, 15 sp, 5 gp, and a vial of crimson liquid that regularly pulses with a dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat. Hymir looks around for anything that might be hidden. 15 He doesn't notice any traps, secret doors, or any such thing."
"I wonder if I know anything I can recall about floating skulls 12 (Just a D20 in case there is a roll, some modifier to top it)"
Dustfinger mutters quietly to himself. 'Shit.' Initiative 5
Initiative. 4 i'd be towards the front
Initiative 4
Fjolnir pops through the door about 10' staying in the hallway. Init 13
"'Sweet, I don't even have to scalp one!' Initiative: 13 Absinthe moves toward the closest enemy."
"Hymir initiative: 18 I'm going to retro that his mage armor is up, he makes it a point to keep that on. Hymir moves past Dirk into the hallway. 'Uh, ah, not close enough, can't see, WAITING UNTIL THEY BUNCH UP,' He yells even though you're all within 20' of him. He holds an action to cast shatter as soon as the zombies get close enough to each other. All of the zombies slowly shamble toward the hallway that the party is cluttering. Several get close enough to hit Dustfinger, but the ones on the other side of the room struggle to make it in a timely manner. 1) Attack: 11 Damage: Unable to parse dice roll. 2) Attack: 9 Damage: 4 3) Attack: 12 Damage: 6 4) Attack: 4 Damage: 2 The zombies stumble into each other, making more than half of their attacks ineffective, but #2 lands a hit. Hymir hears the commotion, and even though he can't see them, he centers his shatter where he thinks he'll get the most zombies. He ends up hitting 1, 2, 3, and 5 for 8 Thunder damage. He also rattles the bellows and the mechanism that connects it to the waterwheel for some damage, but it holds. 'Oops.' CON Saves: 16 / 21 / 5 / 16 1 and 3 take the full blast, 2 and 5 are made of sterner stuff. Fjolnir and Absinthe are up. Absinthe can't currently see anything outside of the room you just cleared, besides a faint green glow from across the cavern. Round 1: This skull is on fire... Light: Dim inside the room, skull emits dim light in 15' radius. 18- Hymir 15- Dwarven Zombies AC: 8/ HP: 22 1) Taken 13 damage, Looks hurt 2) Taken 6 damage 3) Taken 13 damage, Looks hurt 4) 5) Taken 6 damage 6) 7) 8) 13- Fjolnir 13- Absinthe 08- Flameskull 05- Dustfinger 04- Az Emberi 04- Dirk"
Absinthe lights a torch and moves just out of range of the zombies.
"Hesitating, then squatting, and waffling at which creature to target, Fjolnir stops cursing under his breath long enough to conjur hail of thorns on one and send them hastily at zombies 5 then 3. Longbow 9 Dmg 4 Hail of Thorns 7 Hordebreaker 23 Dmg 10"
"Fjolnir's first arrow hits, thankfully, as well as the second. At the same time the second arrow hits, the first arrow bursts and zombies 2, 3, and 5 try to dodge the effects, 3 / 14 / 8 #3 manages to block himself from the full blow, but it doesn't matter much because of the second arrow that struck him. Undead Fortitude DC 15: 5 #3 falls, unable to cling to his unlife. The Flameskull hovers over to the bellows and floats a good 10 feet up from it, chattering the whole time. 'No, no, no! No one enters the forge! No one! HA HA HAHA HA HA!' As he laughs a thin streak of light shoots from its mouth to the middle of the party's position, blossoming with a low roar into a fiery explosion! EVERYONE makes a DEX Save, DC 13. On a failed save, you take 18 fire damage, on success you take half (9). Zombie #4 DEX Save: 15 Hymir DEX Save: 12 Damage applied. Dustfinger, Az Emberi and Dirk are up. Round 1: This skull is on fire... Light: Dim inside the room, skull emits dim light in 15' radius. 18- Hymir 15- Dwarven Zombies AC: 8/ HP: 22 1) Taken 13 damage, looks hurt 2) Taken 13 damage, looks hurt 3) Dead 4) Taken 9 damage 5) Taken 17 damage, looks rough 6) 7) 8) 13- Fjolnir 13- Absinthe 08- Flameskull 05- Dustfinger 04- Az Emberi 04- Dirk"
Duck and cover! 6 Con check vs 19 for maintaining Hex 12
"7 staggers. Gg..... That chattering shit needs to be stopped! I rush ahead of Az and bring my hands to the cock breach in my pants. Now I'm going to show you something, but i'm gonna need you take a step back.... 5 charges expended as I brandish the gem of brightness in an attempt to blind the floating skull and everything else angled as best as possible at enemies. (Damage and charges marked)"

Dex save 18 'H... how the hell is that thing makin noise with too few lungs or lips?'
"Dusty summons his clones and focuses his Hex on the skull with a scorching case of herpes. Then he tries to flee down to the bottom of the stairs by Az, hoping his clones will protect him from zombie attacks. He breathes heavily, putting out small fires on his cloak. 'Heh... Hey, Absinthe . I'll give 100 gold to your favorite charity if you go give that skull a great big bear hug.' Mirror Image, Hex is still disadvantaging Strength"
I cast healing spirit on my spot. Take 4 healing BA move spirit to dustfingers spot.
Dex save: 9
"Round 1: This skull is on fire... That chattering shit needs to be stopped! No, you need to be stopped! 'H... how the hell is that thing makin noise with too few lungs or lips?' Magic! The fireball hits you all as you were unprepared and perhaps unknowing that such a thing could be so powerful. Only Fjolnir was fast enough to see the beam coming and take a position to lessen the blow. Absinthe goes unconscious. Absinthe will most likely use his damage reduction to keep from passing out. 5 18 damage reduced to 13, you are at 3 HP. Dustfinger Hexes the Skull, makes magical copies of himself, and bravely runs away. Three zombies swing at hims as he's trying to escape. #1: 4 Swings at the right Dustfinger. Attack: 18 Damage: 5 aaaaaaand knocks him out. Hex dissapates. The three duplicates mimic Dustfinger and pass out on the ground. #2: N/A #4: N/A Az Emberi (I'm going ahead as your turn is written, if you'd like to change anything, we can retro it. Also just noticed Healing Spirit is actually a Bonus action, in case you wanted to do something else, you still have an action if you'd like to save the magic stones for next turn. Keep in mind if you're going to cast a second spell it has to be a cantrip, since Healing Spirit is level 2.) The druid makes a 5' cube of healing where Absinthe is standing, anyone moving through that spot can roll a 1d6 and heal that amount as long as Az Emberi maintains concentration. He makes sure to take advantage of it himself. Dirk Also moves through Absinthe's spot on the way to the front lines, healing for 3 . He uses his magical gem to create a blast of light and said blast envelopes zombies 1, 2, 4 and 5 and the flameskull. CON Saves DC 15: Zombies: 11 / 8 / 6 / 14 / Flameskull: 22 All four zombies are blinded by the light. The flameskull is not (You have now learned that the flameskull has magic resistance, which grants advantage on saving throws from magic and similar effects.) Round 2: This skull is on fire... Hymir is up. 'Magic resistance? Attack it then! Not fire, probably not fire, what's opposite? Water! We don't have water, do we Hymir? What then? Uh, um, THUNDERSTRUCK!!' Hymir hurls a small ball of thunder energy at the floating skull. Attack: 16 Damage: 13 The flameskull is indeed thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck. Hymir squeezes in with Absinthe to get some healing, 6 then ducks around the corner in the stairwell. The zombies blindly rush the party, clumsily maneuvering over Dustfinger, but filling in the empty spaces until they bump into someone, then swing at them. 1 and 4 swing at Dirk, 2 at Absinthe. 5,6,7, and 8 can't reach anyone and press forward like a back row shark tooth waiting to spring to the front line. 1 vs Dirk: Attack: 13 Damage: 2 2 vs Absinthe: Attack: 7 Damage: 7 4 vs Dirk: Attack: 8 Damage: 7 The blindness allows Absinthe and Dirk to easily dodge or parry the clumsy attacks. End of turn CON Saves: 19 / 23 / 21 / 7 Zombies 1, 2, and 4 shake the effects of blindness as their eyes adjust, 5 is still blind though. Absinthe and Fjolnir are up. Absinthe automatically heals for 1d6 at the start of his turn, so you can roll that before you do anything. Light: Dim inside the room, skull emits dim light in 15' radius, Absinthe holding torch. 18- Hymir 18/30 HP 15- Dwarven Zombies AC: 8/ HP: 22 1) Taken 13 damage, looks hurt 2) Taken 13 damage, looks hurt 4) Taken 9 damage 5) Blinded, Taken 17 damage, looks rough 6) 7) 8) 13- Fjolnir 35/44 HP 13- Absinthe 3 /35 HP 08- Flameskull Taken 13 damage 05- Dustfinger 0 /27 HP (Unconscious, Has 3 prone duplicates) 04- Az Emberi 17/31 HP (C) Healing Spirit 04- Dirk 12/27 HP"
Heal: 5 Absinthe moves toward the nearest zombie to begin squishing then into pulp. Torch club Attack: 8 Damage: 7 Punch to face Attack: 23 Damage: 6
Az Emberi casts the sprite on absinthe's spot walks into it and walks out. Heals for the 4. Then he pulls one bead off his necklace and toses it about 20 feet past dustfinger so the flames don't hit him. All creatures in that radius takes do a dex save to beat 14 or take. 31 . Fire dmg Half on success.
"Retro action! Zombies 1, 2, 5, 7, the Flameskull and the bellows are in the area of effect for Az Emberi's fireball. Dex Saves: 2 / 7 / 14 / 6 / Flameskull: 21 reduced to 0 because, as one would imagine, it is immune to fire damage. Even though zombie #5 made its save, it was already rough, so all 4 zombies in the area were vaporized to ash. #5's Undead Fortitude DC 20: 13 Oh he gone. The bellows is battered and singed and catches flame. This doesn't change much, everyone still walked through the healing spirit without danger of opportunity attack, so all the heals stand. Dirk still hit a couple zombies and the fireskull with blind, #4 is still blinded, the fireskull still made its save. There are just several fewer zombies now. Absinthe steps up to zombie 4 and beats it with his torch, dealing bludgeoning damage and 1 point of fire damage, not enough to kill it, but the secondary punch is. Undead Fortitude DC 11: 13 It barely hangs on to its unlife. Fjolnir is up!

"Fjolnir steps forward into the healing light, and backs out several steps whispering to himself, marking zombie 4 with a Hunters Mark. He looses an arrow at it between Dirk and Absinthe. Heal 1 Longbow 13 Dmg 6 Hunters Mark 1"
"Zombie stay alive save DC 12: 22 Oh yeah, you're peeling parts off but he's still standing. The flameskull continues cackling 'Ha ha haha ha ha ha. Go away! This is off-limits!' and starts to concentrate. A flaming sphere appears amid the party. Anyone who ends their turn adjacent to the sphere must make a DEX Save or take 2d6 fire damage. He remains floating 10' above the bellows. Dustfinger, Az Emberi and Dirk are up. Dustfinger must roll a death save.

"(jack Absinthe up with...) L2 cure wounds 7 , 1 (I seem to have forgotten a dice roll in that, pls add) BARDIC INSPIR****INGATION on Absinthe, Dustfinger, and Fjolnir. SCATTER! Absinthe! Skull **** the skull! Skull **** the skull! I shout, panicking as I run the risk moving north just inside this passage/room to my fullest movement. Assuming I reach this destination.... Tch! This is the most well armed Goblin toilet to ever cackle some half assed, Taxman foreplay dialogue since Grabstd's infamously reviled love poems about stink and eating raw or rotting things. His musings were literally titled RAW OR ROTTING THINGS, love poems! Threats, fireballs, undead I can take... but this thing's musings are insufferable and must be stopped! (I misunderstood the death save, sorry)"
Death Save! 17
I mobe two spots east of dustfinger walking through the sprite for healing. 6 . I ba move it on to dust fingers spot. And thorn whip the skull. 19 dmg 4
"Dustfinger starts to stabilize. Dirk heals Absinthe for 8 total, (even though Dustfinger is making death saves...) Then uses his Mantle of Inspiration. Absinthe, Dustfinger , Fjolnir , and 1 more , gains 5 Temp HP, and can move up to their movement without provoking opportunity attacks. (Just noticed the wording of Mantle of Inspiration, the creatures have to be able to see you as well as you seeing them. Dustfinger is unconscious and can't see you, so he can't benefit from it. You can choose 2 more out of yourself, Hymir and Az Emberi to also gain a free move and Temp HP. If you pick yourself as one you won't get an opportunity attack from the zombie.) Az Emberi moves through the Healing Spirit before moving it onto Dustfinger's spot. (At the start of your next turn you will heal, then you may act on that turn... so long as Az doesn't lose concentration, mua ha ha!) He skirts around zombie #4 trying not to provoke an attack, and successfully hits the floating skull with a Thorn Whip. The piercing thorns do less damage than expected, though. You get the feeling that it is resistant to piercing damage. It is, however, pulled toward you, and is now less than 10 feet from the ground. Just remembered it needs to make a concentration check: 5 The flaming sphere dissipates... Before Hymir goes, I need clarification from Dirk, then I'll need where everyone wants to move with their free 30' of movement. Don't worry, since Dirk and Az have the same initiative, we can say that everything written has happened without going backward.

Hymir and me I guess.
"Hymir graciously accepts, and with the free move he runs to Dustfinger and back away from the zombie to take advantage of the healing spirit. 6 . Hymir looks at the skull again, and seeing the dire need to take it down, blasts it with another level 2 Chromatic Orb of thunder. Attack: 25 Damage: 51 (Holy shit) You watch as a ripple in the air becomes an orb that, while clear, looks to bend light and sound around it. The cavern goes silent as the ball seems to absorb all the sound into itself, then like a bullet it careens into the flaming skull too quickly for it to react. A thunderous crack breaks the momentary silence and peels through the cavern on impact. The skull shatters in a burst of green flame. There is nothing left but a pile of bone shards on the floor. The zombies, independent of the skull, continue the assault. Zombie 4 doesn't move and attacks Absinthe, Zombies 6 and 8 swarm Az Emberi. 4: Attack: 17 Damage: 4 6: Attack: 8 Damage: 5 8: Attack: 7 Damage: 7 #4 hits Absinthe but it doesn't get past his bolstered defenses, thanks to Dirk. The attacks on Az are completely ineffectual. Fjolnir tries to finally finish off the zombie that wouldn't die. He does. It dies. (Not going to bother rolling because you did enough damage to it to make it impossible to save against the DC.) Absinthe is up, then Dustfinger will heal 1d6 and get a turn, then Dirk and Az Emberi . 18- Hymir 24+5/30 HP 15- Dwarven Zombies AC: 8/ HP: 22 4) Dead 6) 8) 13- Fjolnir 36+5/44 HP 13- Absinthe 16+1/35 HP 08- Flameskull- Ba doo be, shattered, shattered.

"Spiritude 4 Dusty's eyes snap open and he leaps up to his feet. 'NO, DADDY, DON'T TOUCH ME THER... oh...hey, guys.'

Ba shillelagh. Beat zombie south of me Atk. 25 dmg 8
"Absinthe isn't quite sure what's going on. He stands there for a second, about to hit the zombie with his torch but there's no zombie there... Surely he must be missing something. Did he black out? Was he just not paying attention? He steps into the healing spirit BEFORE engaging with ZOMBIE #6, 3 and does what he was GOING TO DO TO ZOMBIE #4 (Next time you're going to waste your action hitting a corpse.) Both attacks hit zombie 6. Dustfinger wakes as if from a bad dream, and quickly snaps into action, leaping up and slashing a deep gash into zombie #8 Az Emberi imbues his stick with magic and cracks #6 across the face.

"Fjolnir's arrows connect. (Longbow is 1d8, though, not 1d10) Damage reroll: #8: 7 +1 for Hunter's Mark / #6: 10 It is enough damage to put both of them down. Undead Fortitude: #6 vs 15: 17 / #8 vs 13: 13 And yet, they both remain. Absinthe swings his sword and throws a punch at #6. (If it dies from the sword the punch will go to 8) Attack: 16 Damage: 6 Attack: 11 Damage: 4 Both will hit. Saves: 7 / 20 #6 goes down from the sword attack, #8 stays standing from the punch. Dustfinger changes his focus to #8 since 6 went down, and delivers a powerful blow. Save: 6 The blade comes down hard on the zombie's shoulder and carves into the undead, separating ribs from the spine on the way down, flaying it open like a blooming flower of rotten flesh. It smells horrible, but feels really satisfying to do. Combat is over. A loud boom echoes from the North and from the East. The bellows is smoldering."
*stares slackjawed at the ruined bellows as his hexblade's curse leeches vitality from the sundered undead into Dusty's broken body* 'It's really awful what that flaming skull did to Gundren's bellows.'
"Follow-up post: You EACH gain 250 XP from the flameskull / zombie fight bringing your total XP to 5147 (Az Emberi's healing spirit lasts for as long as he holds concentration, up to a minute, or 10 rounds. Although it is cheap and a cause of much debate on the internet, I'm playing RAW, so technically, if Az Emberi allows it, you all have 6 rounds left to enter and exit the healing spirit every 6 seconds. In other words, everyone may roll up to 6d6 and heal that amount.)"
"26 Heatlh, 20 Stealth, 16 Perception. Well that kind of sucked. Sorry Dust, I thought you were about to get back up. I'm ready for what is next."
"Healing 32 'I'm tapped out of the wizard juice, but I still have a few tricks up my sleeve if we're pushing through. I think we need to check out what's blocking the water in the northern passage.'"
20 'I would prefer to clear the threat before performing maintenance on the bellows but I'm not sure where to go next so we might as well check the blockage.' After everyone has healed I dismiss the spirit.
"Fjolnir moonwalks in a cloverleaf pattern through the healing light. 23 He dusts himself off and pulls an arrow or two from the again inanimate corpses. 'Eh, agreed, i'm spent for concentration... lets secure our position and scope the room out at least first.' He walks over to the bellows and splashes some of his water on the bellows and quickly surveys the bellows, forge, and waterwheel for damage or risk of collapse. PER 12"
"The bellows doesn't seem like it will fall apart, but the leather that encases the air that is supposed to go through the nozzle is now full of burnt through holes and is in need of patching or replacement before it can be used. (To move things along) Hymir and Absinthe use the healing spirit as well. 22 / 18 Everyone is at full health. There are several exits to this room aside from the way you came in. To the South is another way into the cavern of ghouls you've already cleared. The channel exits North and East, is 5' deep and can be climbed into or out of without an athletics check but is only 5' tall once it gets past the cavern walls. Most of you need to duck, Absinthe may need to crawl. There is also a carved passage to the East."

Dirk, Dustfinger, Hymir and Az Emberi all get into position and prepare various actions. While scanning the South wall for the return of the wraith, there's a rustle in Dustfinger's pack, and... chattering teeth noises? Then in an eruption of green flame and horrible laughter, the flameskull bursts out of the pack into the air. 'HAHAHAHAHAHA! I CANNOT BE CONTAINED!' It casts Magic Missile targeting Dustfinger, 2 Fjolnir, 3 and Hymir. 5 You can all decide if you want to let the flameskull trigger your held actions, except Dirk, since he is not in range. Hymir casts shield as a reaction to negate the Magic Missile, but that also takes away his reaction to cast firebolt.

Skull CON Save: 22 The skull takes the blast in stride and cackles some more. He seems to be somewhat resistant to magic in general... Fjolnir fires an arrow at the re-emerged skull but it goes wide and hits the wall. Absinthe rushes the skull and swings 3 times above Dustfinger's head at the laughing skull. He connects twice. The punch to the eye socket leaves a small fracture. Mormesk emerges from the cave wall outside the room, his laughter echoing through the cave, mixing with the chattering cackles of the Flameskull for a maddening, eerie effect. He strikes at Az Emberi, then flies back inside the cave wall out of sight. 7 He has poor aim, however. Az Emberi may NOT make an attack of opportunity since you used your reaction to cast Moonbeam.

"Dirk fires a crossbow at the undead floating skull, but the bolt shatters just before impacting it. It cackles mockingly and Dirk. Then it cackles again as Dustfinger tries to land strikes and they are parried by its invisible Shield. Hymir, trying to think quickly after seeing it has a shield up, and also knowing it's resistant to magic... panics. 'Um, uh, Hymir, what do we do!? Just try to hit it anyway! Ok, sounds good!' He takes a step back and casts Chromatic orb at it: Attack: 13 Damage: 14 Unfortunately, the shield holds strong and the orb of thunder is dispersed harmlessly into the air. Az Emberi, most likely feeling bad about catching Dustfinger in his moonbeam, heals him a bit just before moving the moonbeam back into the flameskull's face. Flameskull CON Save: 12 The moving beam of light catches the skull off guard and it takes the full brunt of the attack. The radiant damage actually burns portions of its fire-resistant face. The green flames around it flare up and it screeches angrily as it's red eyes glow more intensely. One fiery beam from each eye shoots at two different targets, Fjolnir and Az Emberi.

"Fjolnir, seeing double from the severe blast of fire to his face, fires two arrows, hitting both the flameskull and the... moonbeam. One arrow chips a piece off the skull, but it is resistant to piercing damage, and the arrow does not go through. It is looking REALLY bad though. Absinthe Absinthes the skull, getting a little lift from his tree-trunk legs and tries to palm it. 22 But it slips away through his meaty fingers. So he punches it. (I assume you meant the skull, since Mormesk the Wraith is not on the map currently. Like Fjolnir, you must have thought the moonbeam was a wraith) Absinthe feels his punch connect, but when he pulls back the skull is still there, laughing. (He cast shield again). Mormesk pokes his head in through the West wall just below Az Emberi, and swings a spectral claw in his direction again. Attack: 20 Damage: 8 Az Emberi starts to feel less... healthy.

"Fjolnir shuffles 5 or so feet closer to the center of the room, nocks an arrow and readies a shot for the wraith, eyeing the wall where it last disappeared. 'Ye gonna drag this out, eh?!' he barks at the empty wall."
Absinthe moves away from everyone so as to spread out for when the wraith returns. Then holds his attack in the event it comes back hostile. If the wraith engages in conversation Absinthe will stand ready.
"Most of you lie in wait for the wraith to return. Absinthe gets closer to the wall to let his fists do the talking and everyone has spread out a little. A long few seconds pass and the wraith peeks in again. All at once, the moonbeam moves to his location, a firebolt streaks across the room, an arrow is loosed and a sword is swung.

Perish, you interloping mortals!' He focuses on Absinthe. Attack: 10 Damage: 21 ...but can't seem to land a hit. He curses and flees through the wall again, not provoking opportunity from Absinthe.

"All that bravado, I thought it smelled like ancient queef."
"Dirk talks. Dustfinger runs to the door and threatens testicular rubbing of his things. Hymir runs out the door but doesn't see him in either direction, so he holds a firebolt in case he does. 18 He doesn't remember any more than Az about the skull. Az Emberi Has heard of these flaming skulls once before while eavesdropping on someone else's conversation. These unholy things have magic resistance; damage resistance to lightning, necrotic, and piercing; no damage vulnerabilities; damage immunities to cold, fire, and poison; condition immunities to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poison, and prone.

Absinthe releases his dart and Hymir a firebolt that they each had held: Dart: Attack: 12 Damage: 7 Missed Firebolt: Attack: 20 Damage: 5 Hit! However, it doesn't appear to do as much as it should. He reaches Absinthe and swipes: Attack: 17 Damage: 10 and his claw passes through his chest. Then he turns and flees farther into the fungal room, daring you to follow, hiding behind a stalagmite.

"Dirk exits the room after hearing more commotion outside. He can't see Mormesk as he has full cover from the stalagmite he's behind, so he aims his crossbow that direction in case he peeks out. Absinthe, you can't use the 1d6 inspiration die on the CON Save I need from you since you were inspired after the action that required the save. Everyone else may take their turn."
"'MORMADON!' Dustfinger yells as he exits the room and stops at Hymir's right. 'Where are you, you big friggin nerd?!' His double-scimitar begins to crackle with the slowly pooling energies of an eldritch blast, waiting for Mormesk to show ass or elbow to fire off.  If he shows his ass, Eldritch Blast 15 Dam 4"

Az Emberi calls down a beam of moonlight that the drow fails to withstand, and it appears that its skin melts away as it reveals the familiar visage of a doppelganger. Click here:  Hymir strikes with a chromatic orb but misses. Fjolnir looses two arrows with deadly accuracy. His hail of thorns only hits the Doppelganger, though. Dustfinger makes copies of himself and rushes toward the rope nearest the Bugbear, however he only makes it to the stream at this point. Absinthe races across the cavern at blinding speed and shortswords the doppelganger's nethers. Dirk sneaks along the West portion and once he sees the shape changer still standing, he fires a beam of light at its eyes, retaining his invisibility but the creature manages to shield his eyes. Initiative: Doppelganger: 13 Taken 33 damage, looks hurt Bugbears: 15 #1 taken 9 damage Absinthe: 14 Az Emberi: 18 Dirk: 6 Dustfinger: 7 Fjolnir: 21 Hymir: 22 We did all this not specifying a light source for Absinthe and Hymir, but I'm going with one for each due to the size of the cavern. If we retro Absinthe's new mace for his sword, it's the same to hit and won't effect anything, except that now he has light. Hymir can cast light on anything, so not a big deal. We'll say that's what happened. Hymir, Fjolnir and Az Emberi are up again before the bugbears."

Fjolnir chops at the rope and sparks fly as Hew clangs against the piton it's affixed to. The rope snakes down into the gorge, which you can now see is about 20' deep and the stream trickles to the North and flows out of. There are 2 more bugbears in the North half, now alerted to the commotion above. Az Emberi goes wolfy and chomps down on a second rope. It too falls, leaving the northern 2 ropes up for now. Bugbear #1 sees Dustfingers closing in and moves to intercept. It swings with its morningstar. Attack: 16 Damage: 10 The attack passes through one of the mirror copies of Dustfinger, dissipating it. The bugbears in the chasm each attempt to scramble up one of the two remaining ropes. 16 / 22 They have no issues climbing the ropes, however, it takes their entire turn to make it up and only manage to get close to Absinthe and can't strike him yet, but he now has 3 enemies in melee with him.

I attempt to put the dople********er to sleep L1 22
"The doppelganger isn't phased by the sleep magic. It dawns on Dirk that doppelgangers must be immune to charm effects. Dirk feels a moderate amount of tiredness, but it passes as the spell fades and he remains standing. Hymir, Fjolnir and Az Emberi are up. 22- Hymir 21- Fjolnir 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Moonbeam) 15- Bugbears 2) Taken 26 damage, looks rough 3) 14- Absinthe 13- Doppelganger (Taken 51 damage, looks rough) 7- Dustfinger (Mirror Image x2) 6- Dirk"
Az Emberi rushes up to just north of Dirk and pulls the moonbeam to over the dopplegangers head.
"Fjolnir dashes at full Sprint, doning His bow and drawing Hew, tromping through the water, slogging up stairs, and just past Dirk to delay the doppelganger in an engagement."
"Hymir attacks bugbear 2 with a firebolt Attack: 16 Damage: 4 It's enough to put it down. He then move across the stream. Fjolnir makes it adjacent to the shapeshifter, while Az Emberi gets sight on it and moves his moonbeam onto it. The last bugbear swings at Absinthe: Attack: 9 Damage: 11 But still cannot strike the agile monk. Absinthe is up. 22- Hymir 21- Fjolnir 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Moonbeam) 15- Bugbears 2) DED 3) 14- Absinthe 13- Doppelganger (Taken 51 damage, looks rough) 7- Dustfinger (Mirror Image x2) 6- Dirk"
Absinthe attempts to pummel the last Bugbear to redeem hit words. Lightbringer Attack: 16 Damage: 9 Throat punch Attack: 15 Damage: 6
"The Lightbringer staggers the bugbear to the side and actually makes Absinthe's second attack to the throat miss. The doppelganger starts to dive away from Fjolnir to avoid getting Hewn, but is caught in the moonbeam. (With 1 HP left, it wouldn't matter if it did minimum damage and made the save, it's still going to die) It screams as it burns up in magical flame-like light and crumples in a sizzling heap. Dustfinger and Dirk are up. 22- Hymir 21- Fjolnir 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Moonbeam) 15- Bugbear 14- Absinthe 13- Doppelganger- Crispy 7- Dustfinger (Mirror Image x2) 6- Dirk"
Crossbow attack n bugbear Attack: 15 Damage: 8
Dusty gets all up on the last bugbear for some hot steel-on-skin action. Attack 1 9 Damage 11 Attack 2 15 Damage 6
"Dustfinger's first attack misses, and the second glances off the bugbear's armor. Dirk's bolt sticks into its armor to no effect. Hymir, Fjolnir and Az Emberi are up."
I stay where I am but move moonbeam onto the bugbear
"'Damn stinkin' bugbears, nary a one of 'em has ever bathed...!' Fjolnir pops back around the corner, sighting the bugbears engaging Absinthe, nocks an arrow and looses it at the 3rd one. Longbow 25 Dmg 10"
"Hymir holds up his hand, 'These don't miss,' and releases three magical darts that converge on the bugbear simultaneously. 10 Fjolnir sticks an arrow deep into his side, judging from the howl, probably a kidney shot. Az Emberi moons the bugbear, with actual moonlight, not his butt. The bugbear feels the burn: 5 CON Save vs DC 14: 2 He takes 5, still alive! Looking about 2 inches from death, he tries once more, he knows this will be his last attack, so he gives it all he's got: Attack: 22 Damage: 16 Absinthe takes the hit, and it's his turn, as well as Dustfinger's and then Dirk, if someone doesn't do the 2 damage to kill the thing first. I figure Absinthe might do his damage reduction roll on that one, but since his turn is next he can roll it. 22- Hymir 21- Fjolnir 18- Az Emberi (Concentrating on Moonbeam) 15- Bugbear 14- Absinthe 11/35 7- Dustfinger (Mirror Image x2) 6- Dirk"
Shrug damage: 10 Lightbringer Attack: 16 Damage: 8 Bitch slap Attack: 12 Damage: 7
"The lighted mace comes down on the bugbear's head, and it falls backward. Combat is over. What next?"
I look into the casm to see if I can see bugbears down there from the cut lines
"You each gain 217 XP, placing your total at 5804. There are no bugbears in the chasm, just the small stream that trickles out through the rocks to the North. The bottom of the chasm is 20' down and blanketed in rubble. It doesn't take much to realize this area was destroyed during the battle that ended this place's functionality and that the water that now flows to the North was probably supposed to be powering the waterwheel/bellows. You surmise Gundren has a lot of work to do to get this place up and running again, and even more to get it back to its former glory."
"I want to climb down there and try to investigate what they were looking for 2 investigation, but I guess I'm just.... really not that interested in rocks. Athletics 12"
"That's ok, because it's a perception roll. First: Anyone going down the ropes must roll Athletics to get down safely (DC 10). If you fail the check, I'll let you roll your own bludgeoning damage to speed things up (2d6). Then, you can roll 1 perception check per hour of searching through the rocks to see if you can find what they were looking for. I will allow anyone to attempt this. If you don't participate in searching you may take a short rest while others look, so post whether you're resting or searching. Please wait to resolve your short rest until everyone has made a choice. 6"

"Dustfinger moves just north of the innermost curve of the cliff's edge and lashes out with lightning lure at the northernmost zombie, trying to pull it toward him... and over the edge of the cliff in front of it. Strength save vs 14, or else"
"Hymir pushes his way through to the edge of the tunnel and peeks around the corner. Suddenly, just past the first zombie a loud, sharp ringing sound violently cracks the air and the first 3 zombies in the line are caught in an angry burst of sound. Rocks and pebbles break away and splash into the water below. 21 (dam son) CON Saves vs DC 13: 11 / 19 / 4 Zombies 1 and 3 start to fall to pieces, chunks of rotted flesh slaw off their frames and land it wet piles on the ground. Dustfinger moves to the edge of the cliff with a clever plot in mind. He moves a lot closer to the edge than he thought he had to in order to reach the first zombie, but he just barely catches him with a lightning-like whip that extends from his hand. It wraps around the zombie like a lasso and (STR Save vs DC 14: 15 ) the zombie resists getting pulled into the drink. (sorry, man, that was a cool idea) Dirk and Fjolnir are up. 23- Hymir 21- Dustfinger 20- Dirk 19- Fjolnir 13- Zombies 1) 1 HP 2) 12 HP 3) 1 HP 4) 22 HP 5) 22 HP 6) 22 HP 9- Az Emberi 5- Absinthe"

"I can move far enough due east with good line of sight I want to cast a violet faery fire on the lot, square centered on the middle group, probably off to the east a little for LOS. (Marked spell slot)"

They single file it to the party and get in each other's way, stumbling over one another in a completely uncoordinated advance that one would expect of such creatures. They end up in a clump between the front few of you and only zombies 1 and 2 have enough time to strike currently. Zombie 1 at Dustfinger: Attack: 7 Damage: 3 Zombie 2 at Az Emberi: Attack: 13 Damage: 5 Both of you easily move out of the way of the slow attacks.

(rolls below so I don't screw up the post) Zombie 2 crumples upon impact while simultaneously shooting tiny shards at the adjacent mob of undeath. Only zombie 3 manages to dodge the brunt of it. Zombie 1 falls as well. Zombie 3 resists death for now. Absinthe swings at the zombie outlined in purple (Advantage for lightbringer: 7 Unarmed: 24 The knee kick lands for 6 damage.

"Hymir charges a TASER TM Fist attack at Zombie 5. Attack: 25 Damage: 5 He backs up a few feet now that the zombie is too busy convulsing to swing at him. Dustfinger maneuvers around the zombie he's in combat with to get into combat with another one and strikes them both with Toby Toby. It's enough to kill them both, unless they stubbornly refuse to die... Zombie 4 vs DC 18: 19 Zombie 3 vs DC 12: 8 Zombie 3 is cut down, zombie 4 refuses. Dirk takes a stab at #4 again after seeing it refuse to die. Zombie 4 vs DC 15: 9 He finishes the job and #4 goes down. Fjolnir fires a double shot at the remaining two (advantage against #5 14 ) and each one takes an arrow. #5 looks rough. The zombies continue their ambling advance even with thinning numbers, they know nothing else. #5 steps and swings at Absinthe: Attack: 19 Damage: 2 Hit, damage noted. #6 at Dustfinger: Attack: 5 Damage: 5 Whiff.

"Az Emberi gives a pop to zombie 5. Resist death Save: 14 The zombie is at 1 HP instead of being dead. Absinthe cracks the zombie in the same spot and it explodes with light, overriding the zombie's ability to be stubborn about death with radiant damage. (You had advantage, and Lightbringer does extra damage to undead when it hits, but it only had 1 hp, so anything would have finished it, since radiant damage negates Undead Fortitude.) He steps to the last zombie and kicks its face, knocking off a bit of flesh and exposing its jaw. Hymir throws a bolt of flame at the last one in hopes of burning it down and saving energy for the big fight he knows is coming. Attack: 13 Damage: 1 It only clips the zombie and doesn't do much.

"He gone! Dustfinger slices through the zombie, and cuts it again on the way down for good measure. Combat is over, everyone gets 50XP totalling at 5854."
I go south and investigate the dead end. 21
"Water surges into the cavern and crashes against the ledge you're on, making a thunderous BOOM and shaking the ground beneath your feet. The water level raised about 10 feet and now slowly pours out from whence it came. There is no dead end, there is a cut trench that leads from the water wheel and a natural path with stairs cut into it that leads up to the cavern with the Forge of Spells."
"Welp, we can either go back the way we came climbing about, or just go around about back to where we came safely. Stealth 19 Perception 9 after waiting a few moments for someone to take charge. Aight I'm gonna go re-bathe my gear in that fire and if anyone wanted to rest we can deal with that there. I head to the room with the magic fire, will be dousing my rapier 8 , dagger 8 , crossbow 5 , and studded leather armor 2 in the magic fire."
Club. 11 Armor. 7
Fjolnir follows the party to the spellforge and heaps some of his gear into the flames... 'T...this cant be good for this gear...?' Longbow 8 Breastplate 3
'Doesn't seem to hurt it. Magic fire is unique.' 'I wonder what it would do to an immortal chattering skull?'
"Do you want a +1 chattering, evil skull? Because THAT'S how you get one."
"You move toward the hallway to the bellows cavern and see a faint green glow coming from the room. Stopping to listen, you hear the unmistakable chattering and laughter of the flameskull, risen once again and apparently free from its burlap prison, returned to its post."
"Dusty is visibly envious of this skull's durability and clearly wishes he could make a pet of it. 'We should cut back across the chasm where we encountered the doppleganger to avoid the skull. But when we have whatever is needed to put down the skull for good, we should plan a weekend getaway just for the purpose of stomping it into dust.'"
'Aye- i'd like to avoid the damn thing. Er... Can we stuff it IN the forge? Permanent fuel source would be nice...'
"Enough talk. I head back north along the ocean to recross the chasm. I'm assuming strength checks, so.... 12 11"
Dirk makes it across no problem. The rest of you need 2 athletics checks.

Athletics 19 12
Down 5 And up 9 And up again 13
"Fjolnir makes it across just fine. Dustfinger falls as soon as his hands hit rope. He takes 3 bludgeoning, (noted) then has trouble getting up the West side, but manages after a couple minutes. Hymir and Absinthe are the last to descend the East rope. Hymir gets help from Absinthe getting started: 18 Absinthe jumps down afterward, his training allowing him to take the impact. He helps Hymir get started up the rope and then climbs up himself. 12 / 18 They both get to the top with no issues and you all head toward the hallway."
Fjolnir plods carefully up the steps. Stealth: 24 he listens to see if anything living can be heard beyond the caves roaring. Perception 14
You can't hear any noise from down the hall.
I flip up my hood Stealth 12 Creep slowly down the hall.
"'Slain a dragon, but spare those who comply? I might take you up on that. You see, I'm clearing out this mine for future use, and I need help with certain pesky inhabitants. My forces have dwindled recently, mostly thanks to you lot. I'm curious as to who hired you? And also how much money it would take to... change your employer?' The voice still has no visible source. The bugbears simply give up trying to hide and stand there awkwardly. The dwarf stirs but doesn't open his eyes and weakly forces out the words, 'Time for my daily beating? I've told ye already, I don't know!'"
"Our friend Gunther hired us. It might cost greatly for us to change allegiances considering that. Tell me about these pests? I want to try and discern the sex of the voice, high pitch, average or deep."
"Absinthe casually moves up to the closest bugbear, while keeping direct eye contact, drops his robe and stands naked, with Lightbringer in hand down by his leg."
"The voice is most definitely male, middle tones, maybe on the deeper end. 'Gundren? Ah the other dwarf. I see. Well what is he paying you? I can- hey, what are you doing? Stay back you giant oaf! Fine we'll do this your way!' As Absinthe walks just past Dirk, before he can get to the bugbear, 4 giant spiders skitter out from behind the four northernmost pillars on the ceiling. They shoot webs at Absinthe and Dirk. Absinthe: 11 Dirk: 21 Another attempt on Absinthe: 20 Absinthe and Dirk are both restrained. (0 movement, attacks against get adv., your attacks get disadv.) You may use an action to break out with a DC 12 STR check, or someone can attack the webs to get you out. The fouth spider drops from the ceiling right next to Absinthe and attempts to bite him.

"Dustfinger hears commotion outside, and whispers to the dwarf. 'Gundren sent us to help. You're untied now, so wait or run, but my sword is needed in the hall.' (Dust will move into the hall next to Hymir on his initiative tick, and take the rest of his action at that point.)"
"You kind of remind me of this fellow, Hammun Kost? I know we are getting off.... eh.... ****ing webs... on the wrong foot, but we could get this interrogation over with now. Instead of waiting until after we lay waste to your manchild pets and handi-capable, charity hire guards. Struggling in the webs, not free... but free enough to cast Blue Faerie fire in the perfect NE corner 20ft square and then Dirk said.... Let there be light. Bardic Inspiration on Absinthe In a bit of a bind bud, don't let our sticky situation get you down! (L1 spell slot and bardic inspiration marked) Don't worry about me guys, thin the herd."
"Blue light envelopes the NE corner of the room. (DEX Saves: 11 / 19 / 5 ) One spider and the Bugbear now glow blue and give off dim light. Spider web recharge: 11 #2 webs recharged.

"Fjolnir steps forward about 5 feet and whispers a Hail of Thorns conjuration on the arrow before he flies it at the third spider, and immediately sails a second arrow at the first Spider. Longbow+1 21 7 Hail of Thorns Hordebreaker 12 11"
"Absinthe takes 6 total poison damage, 4 from the first bite and 2 from the second. You're down to 8 HP. Fjolnir does his arrow thing. The first arrow sticks deep into the side of spider 3, then bursts, showering both spiders 1 and 3 for 7 piercing damage. DEX Saves: 4 / 17 #1 takes 7 damage, #3 takes 3. The second arrow bounces off spider one's exoskeleton. Absinthe bursts out of the sticky butt-rope and uses his inner ki to leap to a better vantage point that isn't currently surrounded by spiders. From the ceiling just in front of the statue comes the voice that had been speaking. In a tone of vanity that might rival Dirk himself, he says, 'Behold! I, Nezznar, the Black Spider, doom you all to die in this mine. Your story ends here, in an anti-climatic slaughter.' Dropping his invisibility, you see a dark elf dressed in black leather armor and robes, with his feet planted on the ceiling. He clutches a black staff with a carved spider at the top. 'You! Lute player! Your friends are going to kill you... perhaps you should kill them first?' The words resonate with Dirk and mingle with your own thoughts. Dirk must make a DC 13 WIS Save or be influenced by the Suggestion spell to carry out the order to the best of your ability. You have advantage on the roll due to your innate magic resistance. The Black Spider then moves to the NW corner of the ceiling, near the column. Hymir, Az Emberi, and Dustfinger are up. The star is the statue.

Az Emberi steps out of the hall into the room. Snarls and throws a pearl from his necklace at the statue. Every enemy including ceiling guy except spider 2 neds to beat a dex of 15 or take. 31 Fire dmg half on success.  Ba shillelagh
"Dustfinger exits the room and moves between Hymir and Fjolnir. The glowing spider on the ceiling catches his eye, and he casts his Hex over it before following up with a blast of eldritch energy.

"a white gloss fades from Hymir's Eyes as he yells And another thing you necrotic **** why the hell do you dress your zombies up even for a wizard that's weird.... where the **** are we information surges into Hymir's head from months of letting other Hymir 'take the wheel' okay ... uh huh...

"Hymir's tiny spider scurries across the floor to the webs to sense what creatures are in it... Dirk. Only Dirk is encased in the webbing. (There are no other webs in here besides the one that missed Az Emberi, lol) It doesn't have any more movement so it stays adjacent to Dirk. Hymir centers his thunderous shatter spell to include a few spiders in its area. CON Saves: 12 / 19 / 13 #1 takes the full of it, #3 and 4 take 8 thunder damage. Then Az Emberi... oh, Az Emberi. He casually strides forward while plucking a bead off the Necklace of Fireballs. He chucks it to the right of the statue and an explosion of fire erupts outward, encasing 3 spiders and a bugbear, who all attempt to shield themselves from the flames. DEX Saves: 9 / 10 / 14 / 22 . None of the spiders saw it coming. Spiders 1, 3 and 4 and burned to a crisp and shrivel up on the spot. The bugbear ducks behind the pillar, escaping the bulk of the damage, but still screams in pain and many patches of hair are singed all over his body. Dirk and Absinthe are close enough to feel the intense heat, although they take no damage, they understand the pain of the creatures within. The dwarf nods in understanding at Dustfinger without opening his eyes. Dustfinger moves into the hallway just in time to catch the tail end of a fireball shriveling up the majority of enemies, and takes a shot at the ceiling spider. He connects right in his face with a blast of force energy after cursing its ability to move quickly. The bugbears rush from their corners on the assault. Bugbear 1 just makes it to Absinthe and swings his morningstar, #2 swings at the restrained Dirk. Attack: 24 Damage: 18 Critical hit! Absinthe goes down unless he rolls high enough on his Stone's endurance. Attack: 18 Damage: 7 Hit. Dirk gets smacked a bit.

"Boop! I manage to touch absinthe from my web with L1 cure wounds 7 I know I should get out of this, but it's actually quite comfortable. Guys guys, come on in the room, don't be rude now. Mantle of inspiration on Absinthe, Az, Fjolnir and dust. Soak up that +5 hp yall. (marked my uses)"
"Dust is inspired and moves to be next to his inspiring friend, Dirk. He spies Nezznar and starts laughing. 'That's the guy? That's who all this fuss has been about? Hahaha.' He holds his nose. 'Gah, phrear meh. I'm Shnozzshnar. I like shpidhers arnd bows irn myr long pretty haier.'"
Az Emberi moves 30 feet west.
"Walking forward about 15 feet, and just un-shielding his eyes from the fireball, Fjolnir hears Az taunt the attacker, and he yells back with one eye still closed, 'He's 'The Spider', an 'e sends pets, also spiders, ta fight... is it a little derivative and repetitious?!'

Absinthe can make a free move as well. Giant Spider web recharge: 6 Yup. It tries to web Az Emberi this time. 19 Az Emberi is covered in sticky white webbing and is restrained.

"Fjolnir sinks an arrow into the spider crawling across the ceiling, nearly dropping it. Absinthe clunks the bugbear with a solid hit from his mace but doesn't connect with his unarmed strikes. Nezznar yells back at his taunters, 'Of course it's derivative! I'm the Black Spider with a ****ing spider staff and pet spiders! It's meant to be derivative! What would happen if I surrendered? Could I trust that you wouldn't kill me? Would you hand me over to those Lord's Alliance goons? I'm not convinced You'd keep your word.' He seems like he's not 100% against surrender, like he's on the fence about it. He might be swayed with more successful attempts through persuasion, intimidation, or deception. For now though, he casts a Web spell out of his staff at an area on the ground encompassing everyone but Az Emberi. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained . The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

"Hymir gets stuck in the webs and decides to throw out a magic missile, since that can't miss. Three magical darts find their marks. The spider's legs one by one lose grip on the ceiling until it's dangling on one leg like some macabre chandelier. It finally drops to the floor with a thud. Bugbear 1 takes 2 to the face but is still standing. Az Emberi swings at the webs encasing him but the blunt stick has no effect. He cannot move, but Absinthe does get healed. Dustfinger extends his weapon to the bugbear's neck with devastating results. The goblinoid drops and quickly bleeds out. The remaining bugbear steps next to Dirk and swings his morningstar. Attack: 16 Damage: 7 Hit, damage noted. Dirk is up, and while he is already restrained by Spider webs, he is also now in the area of the Web Spell, so he must make a DEX save DC 15 at the start of his turn (with DIS, since he's restrained already), with the potential to be stuck in two different webs.

"4 The bugbear slowly turns its head toward Hymir, making eye contact. While fixing its gaze to the wizard's, it reaches its hand down into the mess of hair in its nether regions. It takes an arrow to the head, just as things start getting good. (Sorry Dirk, that's all you get.) Absinthe is up. Nezznar is all that's left."
Dex save: 18 Absinthe laughs as he avoids the butt rope again with ease. Then charges towards Nezznar with a creepy passionate look in his eye. 'I'm going to do weird things to your corpse!' Lightbringer Attack: 12 Damage: 9 Punch to face Attack: 12 Damage: 5
"Nezznar is on the ceiling, but you missed with both attacks anyway.

Hymir rolls his eyes from the bugbear got an arrow climax'ed through his head before it did anything gross giving him blue balls and non life. to his spider. After making intense eye contact starts focusing on his hands. the spider dashes up the walls and across the room to jump onto Nezznar (dash 30' to the wall from next to Dirk then 20' up) Hymir yells Electro Spider! i do shocking grasp which is normally touch but i can cast through my familiar using the familiars reaction attack 23 Dis 19 dmg 6 if secussfull target creature can't use a reaction As this entire seen plays out perfectly Hymir sees this happening with certainty when he opens his eys and sees the Spider panting and taking a small break 10' from Nezznar...

"Hymir fires a magic missile spell at Nezznar, but the three darts explode on an invisible barrier just in front of him. You recognize this as the shield spell. Az Emberi cuts free of the webs holding him and addresses the Black Spider. 'Indeed?' He has a grin on his face and doesn't seem worried.

"Dirk's magic missiles bounce harmlessly off the shield. Nezznar gives a knowing nod to Dustfinger. 'You're half right. All drow are ********, but I'm sure what I have up my sleeve will work. This was your choice.' The Southern double doors burst open and three more bugbears rush into the room. After taking one second to assess the scene, two of them veer right to attack Fjolnir and one runs up to Az Emberi, into melee range.

"Fjolnir shouts, while dodging blows from two angry Bugbears, '...where the hell is he getting all these damn things, did his mother shag an orc?!' He concentrates his mark on the closest Bugbear, loops the longbow around his neck, drawing Hew and back-slashing at the ugly beasts legs. Hew 22 dmg 9 Mark 6"
"Fjolnir chops deep into the bugbear's leg with Hew. If it were a tree he'd have gone clean through it. Absinthe misses with Lightbringer but connects with his signature throat punch/stones kick combo. Nezznar laughs at the commentary. 'No, these are all Cragmaw bugbears, but I hear they're under new leadership. These few have retained their loyalty to me. And no, large giant-kin, that was not what I had up my sleeve, but you'll never see it.' Nezznar lets out another set of 3 darts at Absinthe. 6 (Wow, ****ing failure) Aggravated that Absinthe is still standing, Nezznar moves abruptly across the ceiling toward the opposite corner.

"Dustfinger struggles against the webs, while channeling his aggravation into Nezznar in the form of his hexblade's curse. If he can just break free, he'd close in on Nazzner's position. 'Dirk, use your gem on this bastard until it works!' (Action: Break free! 12 , Bonus Action: Hexblade's Curse!

"Hymir commands his spider to move across the ceiling at Nezznar, then casts Earthen Grasp on the bugbear. 15 but it holds the fingers open and impedes the crushing blow. Az Emberi lashes out with a vine and catches Nezznar. Thorns press into his arms as the vine rips him off the ceiling and he falls to the floor. 17 He manages to stay standing but takes 4 bludgeoning damage from the fall. He is now adjacent to Az Emberi. Concentration saves: 15 14 The webs remain. Dustfinger tries and can't break free of the webs. He does manage to curse him though. Dirk is up.

"Dirk mumbles to himself for a moment in contemplation. Think I've got it... I whisper. I yell to the bugbear south of me. ' Don't just stand there you blithering idiot! Cut everyone free from the webbing! (Another suggestion) ' as Nezznar. I would also like everyone to know... that I eat shit. I like it hot and steamy, over easy, and a little runny down the side of my mouth."
"Nezznar snarls at the perfect vocal imitation of his voice, and yells, 'No! do not follow that order!' 8 But it was too late, the magic woven into Dirk's words held fast in the bugbear's mind, and it felt compelled to cut the webbing. Fjolnir gets an opportunity attack if he likes. Speaking of, retro AOO from the bugbear on Az Emberi so he avoids Disadvantage: Attack: 24 Damage: 22 (Ouch, marked damage) Bugbear 1 moves to attack Az, #2 moves away from Fjolnir, around the webbing, (Az can get an AOO too if he wants) and over to Dirk to swing at the webs encasing him, #3 stays put and swipes at Fjolnir. vs Az: Attack: 7 Damage: 10 Miss vs Web: Attack: 9 Damage: 16 Miss vs Fjolnir: Attack: 16 Damage: 7 Miss Fjolnir and Absinthe are up, but first, Fjolnir and Az may make atacks of Opportunity if they'd like.

Please write something in the comment box.
"Fjolnir hews at the bugbear in his face and connects for 7 damage. Absinthe smashes the bugbear's head in with a mace-fist combo. It crumples lifeless to the ground. Nezznar bows ceremoniously and says, 'Gentlemen, farewell, I'm sure we'll meet again.' He snaps his fingers and disappears from sight. As he does this, the magical area of webs fades away, and no one is restrained by them anymore. Dirk is still spider-webbed, though.

"Dustfinger swears, knowing something like this would happen. He drops concentration on Hex so he can cover the area all around where Az is moonbeaming with faerie fire. (Dex vs 14) 'BLOCK THE DOORS!

"Hymir Readies his Earthen Grasp and keeps an eye out for any sign of the invisible drow. Az Emberi swings at the fleeing Black Spider and catches nothing but air. He inhales a deep breath through his nose and points straight ahead of him toward the double doors, announcing his presence, following him with a moonbeam. The Moonbeam hits just outside the double door, revealing faint motions of dust particles in the air. Hymir trusts the moonbeam location and attempts to catch him in an earthen fist but realizes the drow got out of range of the spell's influence. moves the earthen hand to the edge of its range, just barely catching the Black Spider in its fingers. As Nezznar tries to break free, Hymir says, 'No! I've seen this before, you don't get away. I may be an *******, but I'm to be respected!' Nezznar takes 4 Bludgeoning damage and is restrained. Dustfinger casts Faerie Fire on the Moonbeam. 7 The shape of Nezznar is outlined in light, and he pauses to look at his situation, and his glowing arms, growling in anger.

"'Where ya goin, Dirk was talking to ya!?' Momentarily inspired by Dirk's taunting while sawing ineffectually at the web, Fjolnir ignores all caution; Focusing his mark on the Drow, he dashes and slides between the bugbears legs, dragging his axe noisily behind him, making haste to the door, and heaving it overhead between Hymirs' earthen avatars fingers, at Nezznars center of mass.

Dustfinger Hits it square with a blast of Eldritch energy, which staggers it to near death... again.

Az Emberi continues walking towards the entrance.
"i suppose we should make it back to town i'm curious to the fate of this one i feel he has more to tell... wakes up Nezznar after making sure his restraints are secure I have some more questions for you tell me.... (trails off) for DM So Nezznar you obviously got to were you are by amassing fortune but even rich people don't get this far it's appears you are at least some type of clever, you stated you wish to get your fortune back but you are looking at incarceration or possibly death. 1. do you have the will to live no matter what or only live under your own circumstances? 2. are you willing to work off some of the charges that will most definitely be placed on you 3. and this is the most important to me with only your skills and no items or equipment are you useful?"
"Absinthe removes the shackles from Nezznar since he has ropes securing him as well. Wraps the chain through skulls mouth then puts him in a sack, then in his backpack."
"7 Ow.... 3 ****! 8 GOD DAMN IT! 14 At some point, perhaps after everyone else I meander out of the cave, looking like I spent 15 minutes in a dryer full of rocks on tumble dry."
"Dusty also scrambles to the exit, eager to get out into the fresh air and back to Neverwinter."
"On the way out, Hymir and Nezznar converse. Anyone who is close and paying attention to their conversation may look at this spoiler: So Nezznar you obviously got to were you are by amassing fortune but even rich people don't get this far it appears you are at least some type of clever, you stated you wish to get your fortune back but you are looking at incarceration or possibly death. Possibly. I guess we'll have to see what happens with that before I can make any more plans, won't we? Do you have the will to live no matter what or only live under your own circumstances? That is an interesting if not loaded question. Obviously I'd prefer not to live in a cell for the rest of my life, but I have a lot of years left, so if the time spent in jail isn't too taxing I might make it. Are you willing to work off some of the charges that will most definitely be placed on you? Hmm. I hadn't thought of that. If it reduces my sentence and passes the time more quickly, that might be an option. This is the most important to me, with only your skills and no items or equipment are you useful? In what way? You mean do I have any other skills? Useful how? Absinthe places the once-again-dead skull in his pack. Everyone makes their way out of the cave without incident, except Dirk. Dirk gets out of there about an hour and a half after everyone else and must make the trek back to Phandalin alone. Climbing up the rope, his first attempt doesn't get him far, then he falls for 3 bludgeoning damage. (noted) His second attempt doesn't do well either, but he eventually makes it up and out. Nundro stops at the body of his brother. 'We have to bring Tharden back to town and bury him proper.' The horse and cart have surprisingly been left untouched, and it's easy enough for Nundro and one other to get the dwarf's body on it. The daylight is welcoming, if not too bright, and after a considerable amount of time adjusting after a few days in a cave, you start moving through the hills toward Phandalin. It's about 12 miles West back to town from the cave. However, just under 3 miles into your trek, Absinthe's backpack starts screaming and catches fire. What are you doing?"

I have removed these three items from your inventory. The backpack itself is singed and looks as though it wouldn't survive another flameskull resurrection. The manacles you used on it fell out through its cracked jaw. What are you doing? Hymir continues conversing with Nezznar. He doesn't hide his response. 'Look, obviously I'm facing trial at the hands of the court in Neverwinter. My goal is to spend the least amount of time in jail as possible. As far as being 'useful' to you? I'm not some hireling. I'm no minion. I am a noble, I don't work for people, people work for me. Do you think I'd be satisfied working for someone who ruined my entire empire? That I'd be happy alongside someone responsible for my need to start anew? You're dreaming. Show me it's worth being 'useful' to you, then we'll talk.'"
Very interesting your responses.... remarkable... continues to very obviously writing down answers and notes... there are some facts you should consider and i would like to introduce to you and if you could respond to the best of your abilities that would be helpful 1. i am objectively better than you in the fact that i completed my goal and you did not 2. nothing said here may have an impact on your sentencing or fate 3. I will never need to show you anything or prove anything to you nor will I and nor would i want to 4. although you have almost no influence on your fate i find it fascinating that you would hypothetically choose a incarcerated noble over an apprentice that would definitely gain more power than you currently have. to think you actually value status over power absolutely remarkable... i owe other Hymir 5 gold continues furiously writing
"Nezznar laughs. 'I wouldn't 'gain more power' as your apprentice than I would by myself. You must be delusional, as evidenced by your personality disorder. Insulting, really, that you think you could teach me, or that you're my better. So be it, I asked for a convincing argument and you refused, instead preferring to respond with insults. Your choice.'"

We take Nezznar straight to Sidlar in the town hall building.
"Dustfinger escorts Nundro to the healer, and pays some urchin a silver to send for Gundren."
"(OK, Dustfinger go ahead and remove a silver. I know, big deal right?) Dustfinger has Nundro in front of the cleric just before she's about to leave the shrine of luck. The child 8 runs off with your silver, never to be seen again. The cleric casts a small cure wounds spell on him and he immediately seems to have more energy and some of the wounds on his face heal up. Dirk snores about 8 miles away in a cave. The rest of you escort the bound Nezznar into the town hall, where both Sildar and Gundren are seated on opposite sides of a desk and abruptly stand at your entrance, speaking over one another in excited greeting to the point that you can't understand what either of them is saying. Sildar stops and steps back to let Gundren speak. 'Aye! Welcome back, lads! Where... Oh. Did ye not all make it? What of me brothers? Did ye not find them either?' Gundren's eyes start to well up with tears. He seems to not notice yet that you have The Black Spider with you. Sildar, however, locks eyes with Nezznar."
'Your brother Nundro has been taken to the cleric in town for healing. He's a banged up but was walking on his own. Your other brother wasn't as fortunate. His body is on our cart outside. I'm sorry for your loss. The mine has been cleared.'
"'Thank ye. If you'll excuse me for a moment.' Gundren squeezes around all of you and exits. Sildar moves toward the group. 'If you've taken everything off of him, place him in the cell. I'll move him to Neverwinter for his trial as soon as possible.' Gundren and Nundro reunite and come back into the town hall. 'Well if the mine's been cleared, there's a deal we have tae uphold. It'll take a while before we turn a profit, lots of work to do, but you'll know as soon as we do.'"
Fjolnir searches Nezznar one last time to make sure he hasnt pocketed anything to break free. investigate 8 'w...where the hell is dirk...? I haven't seen him in hours...'

"Ice knife DEX Saves: 7 / 7 / 15 Faerie Fire DEX Saves: 2 / 4 / 1 Az Emberi's Ice shard sticks in the fat belly of the middle ogre, (dubbed Middy) who stares at it, unaware of its origin. As he reaches to pluck it out, it explodes. He and the left ogre, (dubbed Lefty) are not fast enough to dodge the shards, Righty (the one on the right) does though. All three are encased in Dustfinger's beautiful light show, and are now sparkly. Absinthe bounds across the battlefield to bash Middy with Lightbringer, and connects with that and a punch to the throat.

"Dustfinger joins the charge against the ogres, summoning his mirror images as he moves toward the unharmed ogre, cursing it with his hexblade powers. (Keep my movement the same, action spent on Mirror Image, bonus spent on hexblade's curse)"
"Fjolnir finishes out the surprise round with a two arrow volley to Middy and Lefty. Middy is struck but the arrow for Lefty bounces harmlessly off his hide armor. Absinthe hits Middy with three more strikes doing a total of 19 damage, and the giant-kin looks rough. Dirk levels his crossbow and sinks a bolt directly into Middy's heart, dropping the beastly guy with a giant thud. Az Emberi pulls a magical flame blade from thin air on the way to his target (Which you would have been able to reach if Middy was still alive. As of now, you'll be 5' away from Lefty, so you could hold the flame blade attack until it gets closer, or use your action for something else. You will not be able to attack with your shillelagh this turn either way since it would be a bonus action and you already used that to summon the flame blade.) Dustfinger is in the same boat as Az, 5' away with 30' of movement, I assume at Righty because that's you were closest to. You can either hold your attack action or select another action.

"You continue your trek back to town, figuring you're only about an hour away. A loud crack of thunder rings your ears and all your hair stands up as Dirk is suddenly struck by lighting.

"Dirk webs the shit out of those unsuspecting stirges. (They make dex saves on their turn, we'll get to that soon.) 21 / 7 While Dirk was gyrating, Az Emberi hears something behind them, a leathery flapping noise, but he's too late to alert the rest of the party. Before he can call out, a loud rumbling is heard from behind the party is stunned to see Venomfang land just feet behind you. He is enraged and frothing at the prospect of destroying you, nothing like the deal-making young dragon you met before. ' VENGEANCE!!!' Az Emberi, you're up first. Then Venomfang. Surprise Round 21-Az Emberi 7 Venomfang"
Instinctively Vengeance! I say in the most mocking imitation of Venomfang.
Az Emberi ba goes wolfy and moves 30 feet west to break up the grouping. He swirls his hand over his head as he walks the white fluffy clouds come together and turn dark.

"Absinthe moves some distance in some direction. 30' East and holds an attack action in case anything gets into melee. Az Emberi pulls another bolt from the sky into the hovering dragon, who 9 doesn't manage to get out of the way in time. Then he heals up Dustfinger a bit, who looked like he took a rough hit from the poison breath. Dustfinger vanishes through a rip in some unseen fabric, as if he was pulled through a curtain opening that left no trace of movement. You aren't sure if that's good or bad... The stirges all attempt to scatter out of the webs that Dirk slung at the treetops. 12 / 21 / 20 / 10 Two of them slip out before the webs take hold, two of them get tangled in it. The two that get out head down toward Absinthe, who is the closest to the trees.

Fjolnir fires two arrows in quick succession after marking Venomfang. The first one bounces off his hide but the second one finds a weak point in his natural armor and sinks in deep. Breath recharge check: 3 Nope. Venomfang dives with incredible speed toward Az Emberi. 'Your lightning is getting annoying!'

Bite: Attack: 13 Damage: 14 Claw: Attack: 8 Damage: 12 Other Claw: Attack: 9 Damage: 14 Whether through luck, or skill, or the clumsiness of this particular volley of attacks, nothing pierces Az Emberi's armor to do any damage.

You do, however, extract 20 teeth, 5 claws, and 6 good-sized scales. Fjolnir: You do not gather as much hide as the last time you killed this foe, about 45 pounds this time. I added all the newly scavenged bits to the party loot. Hymir: You haven't heard that Nezznar escaped yet. You will, perhaps by the end of the day or the next day, but it's only been a few hours after the party found Sildar knocked out and Gundren has not yet returned to the mine. He will soon, so that being said, at the point in time when you do actually send this message to Nezznar, he does not respond. Within the first day or two of studying in the mine, the Flameskull returns to its post. you will have your hands full for a while learning the ritual and gathering the materials required to 'reset' him so that he doesn't see the new owners of the mine as enemies. You can feel free to pop in from time to time and cast sending, but be aware of how busy Hymir is and how slow the time passes in the thread. After the Flameskull is rebound to the bellows chamber, Hymir's next goal was summoning the Gazer (or whatever that thing is called, the mini-beholder) and then re-igniting the forge of spells to its former glory. This is month's worth of work, but Gundren will have crews for the physical restoration of the mine and its equipment while you're doing that bit. Bottom line: It'll be a while before this place turns a profit, and it'll consume most of Hymir's time doing so."

"Currently, all of you on the top deck see a multitude of large shapes surrounding the boat underwater. They appear fish-like in their movement, yet they seem to have arm-like limbs or fins toward the front. It's impossible to make out any more details through the waves, but they are keeping pace with the boat. Absinthe and Dustfinger, as well as the rest of the crew below deck, hears the captain's call to arms. 10 14 19 Notes: The rigging can be climbed without making any kind of check, it is around the mast and will allow you to cross the center of the ship to get to the other side without going around. You can make a ranged attack against any one of the creatures if you're above deck and against that side of the ship, but since they're a few feet underwater it will be at disadvantage. There are 9 dark shapes underwater on either side of the boat. Let me know if you would like to start from a different location, you can be anywhere on the boat. There are 2 people operating each boat-mounted weapon. If there is ever not 2 people on a weapon, it will not be able to fire. Anyone may take the place of a weapon operator if they fall, but for the most part the other guards lined up along the sides of the deck will take care of that. Mary, Garrett, and Gearbox are on the map and will act on their turns. Anyone, on their turn, can call out what you want them to do as a free action, otherwise they will act to the best of their abilities. However, now that they are aiding the party they can be targeted. Captain Miggetter, His first mate and bosun are on the map. The captain will be calling orders and keeping the ship on course, the other two will act as his bodyguards to make sure he can continue doing that.

Az Emberi moves to the center of the ship and casts call lightning (assuming there isn't an existing storm to take comand of.) He casts a lightning bolt at one of the damaged ones under the water. Must make a DC 15 dex save or take. 12 Lgt dmg. Half on success.
"Az Emberi conjures a cloud above the ship toward the front and brings down a bolt of lightning at one of the merrow. (The damaged ones are all dead, so we'll hit #1) DEX Save: 2 He takes the full hit. The merrow break the surface again, all of them. The guards , along with all the others that were holding attacks, unleash upon them as they send a volley of harpoons at the guards on the ship. (here we go again) Dirk releases his chaos bolt at #14 for 20 THUNDER damage. Gearbox lobs a javelin at #16, Attack: 13 Damage: 7 it hits and slices across the merrow's arm.

The two guards are now drowning 10' below the waves. The other three guards that won the strength contest are pinned to the railing, but are still trying to function as crew members. The Merrow that missed their targets dive 10' back underwater. One guard fills in on the ballista in the front where a guard was taken from by Merrow #3, leaving all weapons fully manned. #17 Save for Hideous Laughter: 17 Success, but he did get left behind a little and missed his turn.

"(Correct last post) Absinthe uses a dash action to make his way around the boat towards the man stuck by the spear. On my next turn Absinthe continues towards the skewered man, if I need to dash again I will. If I can reach him I will try to pull the spear from him, if I can't pull it out this turn then I will grab the rope so the merfolk can't pull on it."
"(Retro) Absinthe leaps across the opening in the deck and shoves past other crewmembers in order to get next to the man who was harpooned. Absinthe in real-time probably realized the guy he rushed up to is no longer in a strength contest with a merrow, even though the player controlling him didn't realize that Merrow died, or that three other guards are now fighting for their lives. So, instead of ripping out what is basically a fishhook from the guy who isn't in immediate danger, I'm assuming you're going to want to get to a different guard and try to unhook them? I'll roll athletics for you: 6 Unfortunately, you accomplish nothing. Dirk hits #18 square in the face with a chaotic bolt of fire.

"Az Emberi reaches to the sky, makes a fist and pulls down, forcing lightning to strike the merrow in the water. It shudders as it's being electrocuted and after the flash and deafening boom, a charred vaguely fish-like person is all that remains. (I wrote this before I realized I needed to roll a DEX Save for him... 8 You know what, **** it he takes full damage because... DM error in your favor) This frees the guard on the mangonel from struggling against the large aquatic terror. Guards and Merrow again. First, the three merrow who managed to kill their prey dive deeper until they're out of sight, easily carrying their meals. The other two merrow essentially have their guards grappled and can move them at half speed, which still puts them 30' below and out of sight. With no swim speed, disadvantage due to heavy armor in water, and being smaller size and lower STR than the merrow, the guards are doomed to drown. (So for those that didn't catch the OOC chat, that means you have 1 round to save any still living guard that gets pulled overboard before they are lost forever.) The guards use their spears to attack the merrow as they surface again. 2@ #6: Attack: 18 Damage: 3 / Attack: 22 Damage: 3 3@ #9: Attack: 14 Damage: 5 / Attack: 17 Damage: 6 / Attack: 4 Damage: 3 3@ #13: Attack: 4 Damage: 7 / Attack: 21 Damage: 3 / Attack: 14 Damage: 3 5@ #14: Attack: 22 Damage: 5 / Attack: 8 Damage: 5 / Attack: 15 Damage: 6 / Attack: 17 Damage: 3 / Attack: 7 Damage: 5 2@ #15: Attack: 9 Damage: 6 / Attack: 14 Damage: 6 #14 dies. Absinthe is able to keep the guard on deck as the merrow's corpse tugs the rope on its way down. Merrow 9 already has a guard hooked and attempts to pull him over again: 20 vs 17 It succeeds, the guard is violently yanked overboard and disappears beneath the waves. (There's still a short amount of time to save him though) The other Merrow go for another volley: Attack: 7 Damage: 11 / Attack: 14 Damage: 12 / Attack: 7 Damage: 14 / Attack: 19 Damage: 8 / Attack: 19 Damage: 10 / Attack: 10 Damage: 11 / Attack: 17 Damage: 10 / Attack: 21 Damage: 7 #1, 4, 13, 15 and 17 all hit, of them, only #1 doesn't kill the guard with the initial strike.

"Absinthe decides to taunt on of the merrow into throwing its rope spear at him. He flails his hands over his head and shouts, 'Hey, over here! Throw one of those spears at me! I want to see one!' with the intent of using his deflect missile attack and pull one of them fish up on to the boat."

Absinthe continues to taunt number 5. 'I'm not good at making people want to hit me. Maybe it's because I'm big and strong or maybe because you have such a tiny fish dick!'
"I move to across from Absinthe, adding to his tirade, but on 6 with a vicious mockery. It all makes sense now! This must be the little fish stick brigade! The overcompensation here must rival the sad, sexual experience any of your partners hath met? In a shakespearian melodramatic swagger OH, oh do me next bipedal carpman! Let me know if you hit me though, for I doubt even my pores will register your prick. 2 + 2 (Right, level 5, one more dice) I over dramatically place my right wrist over my fore head in a feign of agony. 16 Intimidation"
"What the Folk? Round 5 or something. While Absinthe and Dirk don't accomplish much with their flailing and intimidation, Dirk does get some magic laced into his words. WIS Save: 9 Unfortunately, it falls on deaf ears. Gearbox has run out of javelins and shrugs. He looks up to Garrett for some direction but is offered none. He takes the dodge action. The ship stays on course and Miggetter yells, 'We've almost got them! Keep at it! Help the men on the side of the ship!' The Mangonels, already aimed at #5 and 6, lob their large rocks at the underwater guard-thieves. #5: Attack: 7 Damage: 23 #6: Attack: 14 Damage: 20 Both 5 and 6 are slammed with giant stones and burst in a cloud of red, despite being harder to hit below the surface. Only Merrow #2 remains. Mary moves her Hex to #2 and tries to hit with her long-range Eldritch Blast x2. Attack: 24 Damage: 6 / Attack: 20 Damage: 4 Focusing her energy, she burns a hole right through the creature. It lists away from the ship... and down. COMBAT IS OVER! You assist the guards that went overboard in getting back on the ship. The injured are taken below deck to rest and recuperate. Garrett brings Gearbox down to assist while Mary sits back down and shuffles her deck of cards some more. Miggetter sighs and gathers his crew to say some words honoring the passing of the guards that went below in an attempt to keep morale up. He notes that you're still a few days out from the next port, but should be good to continue as far as supplies are concerned. He mentions he would understand if any of the crew didn't want to continue sailing after going through an event like that, and that he would be hiring more crew members to fill the unfortunate new openings. A couple of the crew seem traumatized, especially the ones pulled over and rescued. some of them seem to have been good friends with ones that are no longer among the living. You managed to kill 9 of the 18 Merrow, netting a substantial amount of XP for the party. However, since you received a lot of help taking them down, you technically 'split' the XP with whoever helped. For the sake of ease, I'm just going to say the party gets half XP, which is still a decent 405 XP for each of you. Grats! Is there anything you'd like to do right now? It's midday on your second day of travel, you have 3 full days and another few hours before you're docked in Baldur's Gate. Good time for an RP break..."
Dirk is especially tired and lazes about when not tasked or otherwise engaged.
Az moves to the center of the ship and calls forth the storm pulling a bolt from the sky to hit the (sow-wyn maybe?) that is on the deck. Dex save 15 or 13
"(It's pronounced, Sa-HOO-wa-gin. Hard G, like Gold. Just... odd) Az pulls down lightning from the sky because he thinks it's cool. He's not wrong, it's pretty cool to command lightning. (I'm going to assume you center it on the large creature, since that would prevent the guards from getting hit as well.) DEX Save: 22 He sees you casting the spell, however, and as the cloud is forming he braces himself and avoids the brunt of the lightning damage. (Takes 6) The First Mate and Boson each lean out to their respective sides and fire arrows at the closest sahuagins climbing the boat. Attack: 13 Damage: 10 / Attack: 22 Damage: 10 Both hit! 7 and 8 each take 10 peircing. On the right side (Starboard? IDK) of the ship, emerges a female Sahuagin . You can tell because... well you can just tell. The priestess sets her sights on Fjolnir atop the mast and casts Hold Person. WIS Save DC 12 or Paralyzed: 20 Fjolnir shakes the feeling of his tensing muscles, just as a magical trident materializes in his face. Attack: 12 Damage: 4 Fjolnir ducks the swing and somehow manages to stay atop the mast. The priestess dives a few feet down. The Sahuagin climbing up the ship see the guards ready their spears, and as if to say, '**** that,' they simultaneously drop into the water and disappear under the boat. Garrett , about to attack one of the fish-men on the side, turns his focus to the big guy and casts Hideous Laughter on it. WIS Save DC 13: 13 The four-armed Baron does indeed emit a burst of hideous laughter, but because the spell failed to take hold of it. Garrett gives Az Emberi Bardic Inspiration. 25 A loud BOOM is heard from the bottom of the hull. It felt like something hit the ship pretty hard. Dirk is up.  19 Dirk 17 Dustfinger 16 Guards 16 Sahuagin Baron (Taken 11 damage) 13 Captain 12 Az Emberi (C on Call Lightning, Bardic Inspiration d6) 12 Fjolnir 12 First Mate & Bosun 11 Sahuagin Priestess (2nd: XX) 10 Sahuagin (AC: 13 hits) #7 (Taken 10 damage) #8 (Taken 10 damage) 9 Absinthe 9 Garrett (1st [X][][][] / Inspirations: [X][][]) 8 ??? 7 Mary 2 Gearbox"
"Worst, surprise.... ever. Move to diagonal position up and to the left of Fjolnir, take out the wand of magic missile and whip it..... like with finesse. Ugh, toss this one back. I'd rather haul up and eat junk than deal with this... bleh... whatever it is. L6 Magic missile on Sahuagin Baron Cohen. Unable to think of anything inspiring to say. .... Eat s***! 16 Bardic inspiration on Fjolnir (d6) Hey Fjolnir! Don't lose your head!"
"Round 2: Sahuagin! (Sa-HOO-wa-gin) Dirk moves past the guards and onto the netting attached to the mast, then whips his wand back and forth. Eight magical target seeking darts find their way to the Baron, and he growls in pain. (You actually do 24 damage with that roll, because each dart does 1d4+1) Fjolnir feels inspired. Dustfinger pulls a classic warlock Hex/Eldritch Blast combo, giving the Baron disadvantage on STR Checks, and shooting two beams of force: Attack: 16 Damage: 5 /Attack: 18 Damage: 1 Both hit for 6 total force damage. The two Guards adjacent to the Baron stab at him with their spears, but having thrown so many overboard during the last encounter, the remaining guards are reluctant to throw any more. They do hold their attacks for anything that gets in melee range. Attack: 13 Damage: 5 / Attack: 8 Damage: 6 The large creature bats both spears away with ease. The Baron starts foaming at the mouth at the blood-covered guard in front of him, going into a frenzy. He bites at the guard: Attack: 24 Damage: 7 He bites around his waist and tears the guard in half. One bloody chunk screams the last of the air it had in its lungs as it careens into the sea, chumming the waters. Aside from a bit of torso that remains in the Baron's mouth, the other half of the guard drops below deck. The rowmen start to panic between pounding from below and literal raining men. The Baron ignores the guard behind him and moves toward the Druid that just called lightning from the heavens down upon him, taking an attack from the guard: Attack: 19 Damage: 3 The guard slices the back of its thigh. Az Emberi fields two attacks from the Baron, one from its claws: Attack: 26 Damage: 10 and one from its trident: Attack: 11 Damage: 20 Luckily, Az ducks the trident, because that looks like it would've been nasty, but the claws got him. AZ Emberi must make a CON Check DC 10 to maintain concentration on the storm. The Ship starts to slow down due to the hiccup in the lower deck. Miggetter yells, 'Get back on track! We need to keep moving! These things are worse than Merrow, they'll eat half of us and kill the rest for sport, it's us or them.' Az Emberi and Fjolnir are up. 19 Dirk 17 Dustfinger 16 Guards 16 Sahuagin Baron (AC 16 / Taken 44 damage, looks hurt) 13 Captain & Keel Breaker (Taken 5 damage to underside) 12 Az Emberi 28/38 (C on Call Lightning, d6 Bardic Inspiration) 12 Fjolnir (d6 Bardic Inspiration) 12 First Mate & Bosun 11 Sahuagin Priestess (2nd: XX) 10 Sahuagin (AC: 13 hits) #7 (Taken 10 damage) #8 (Taken 10 damage) 9 Absinthe 9 Garrett (1st [X][][][] / Inspirations: [X][][]) 8 ??? 7 Mary 2 Gearbox"

"Az Emberi , even through inspiration, can't keep concentrating on the storm cloud and it starts to dissipate. He moves around Dirk through the rigging and places himself in position to cast Thunderwave. CON Save: 23 He digs his claws into the deck and remains aboard. Az heals himself and remains in the Baron's face. Fjolnir fires a set of two arrows at the four-armed freak. Using his inspiration, he's able to make both arrows connect with his target. (With Hunter's Mark, you roll a d6 each time you hit, so here's more damage for you: 1 ) The creature is looking rough. The First Mate and Bosun fire arrows at the big guy: Attack: 9 Damage: 5 / Attack: 23 Damage: 6 One arrow gets through his armor, and it howls its horrid scream but doesn't go down. The Priestess fires a Guiding Bolt up at Fjolnir: Attack: 12 Damage: 13 but it misses. She attempts to hit with the magic floating trident again: Attack: 15 Damage: 8 but the trident bounces off his armor. The Sahuagin clamber back up one side of the ship, focusing their attacks. Some of the Guards take their held attacks: Attack: 6 Damage: 6 / Attack: 12 Damage: 2 Attack: 14 Damage: 6 / Attack: 13 Damage: 2 Attack: 22 Damage: 4 / Attack: 12 Damage: 7 Attack: 23 Damage: 13 / Attack: 4 Damage: 2 All damage was applied, #6 took a solid beating from both sides and is barely standing.

Absinthe runs from below deck and sahuagin. Lightbringer Attack: 18 Damage: 7 Short sword Attack: 26 Damage: 10 Running to number 1
"Absinthe bolts up the steps and strikes twice quickly at the sahuagin, doing severe damage but not dropping it. The Sahuagin, however, hadn't yet attacked and was holding it in case someone stepped up. It bites and stabs at Absinthe as he approaches: Attack: 5 Damage: 3 / Attack: 23 Damage: 11 The bite is way off but the spear catches Absinthe in the side. (You can roll for your damage reduction reaction if you want.) Garrett moves next to Gearbox producing a shortsword. He attacks Sahuagin #7: Attack: 11 Damage: 14 but misses. 'I'm here, little doohickey!' His words give inspiration to the clockwork creature. Another BOOM from beneath the ship echoes through the lower deck. 23 The rowers are having a hard time concentrating and are starting to get uneasy. Mary casts Hex on Sahuagin #5 and fires off 2 Eldritch Blasts in its direction: Attack: 8 Damage: 5 / Attack: 15 Damage: 3 One hits for 3 force damage, with another 3 necrotic. Gearbox attacks Sahuagin #7 with his javelin: Attack: 9 Damage: 5 with Inspiration: 4 They hit with the help of Garrett's inspiring words. They stay where they are.

"Annoyed at it's resilience. I said DOWN BOY! Dirk winds back, Tides of Chaos 7 (wild) to throw 18 chaos bolt at advantage at Sashimi Baron (I'm going to make him explode) 1 + 7 + 10 ACID damage"
"Round 3: Sahuagin! (Pronounced: Sa-HOO-wa-gin) Dirk releases a jet of pure chaos that takes the form of acid on the way to the target and slams into the heavily wounded Baron's chest. His torso explodes in a shower of burning sushi and he silently topples over the railing back into the water. Dustfinger , who had an eldritch blast lined up for the big guy, changes his target to Sahuagin #7 to assist Garrett and Gearbox.

Toasty! Followed by a big fat smirk. I'll just call it a Dirk Smirk from now on.

I step next to the guard that took 7 dmg diaganal from sanguin 5. Ba flame blade 3rd level Atk. 10 Dmg. 17
"Az Emberi crosses the rigging to assist the guard against sahuagin #5 but it dodges the attack from his magical flame blade. Fjolnir sinks 2 arrows into sahuagin. The first one downs #8, it enters through one of its large eyes and exits out the bottom jaw. It topples overboard. Fjolnir focuses his aim up the side of the boat to the next one in line, being #5. The arrow hits it in the leg, but it still stands. The first mate & bosun reassess their targets. One shoots at #5 and the other aims at the Priestess in the water. Attack: 13 Damage: 3 / Attack: 7 Damage: 3 The First Mate glances an arrow off #5 while the Bosun missed the priestess. The priestess surfaces to cast Mass Healing Word on all the Sahuagin on the deck, then disappears back under the waves. Healing: 5 A second, previously unseen priestess emerges, also casts Mass Healing Word, and dives back below. 6 The freshly healed Sahuagin, (some healed to full) are invigorated and go into a frenzy at the smell of blood from their prey. #1 vs Absinthe: Bite: Attack: 18 Damage: 5 / Spear: Attack: 23 Damage: 10 Both hit, 15 damage total.

"Absinthe exclaims that he is growling, then swings a few times at the fish people. He uses his reaction first to reduce some of the incoming damage: 6 (up to 10) He also gets a bonus unarmed: Attack: 24 Damage: 8 He misses with his first strike but connects with the second and a punch in the face. Sahuagin #1 is looking rough. Garrett assesses the situation and hits #5 with some magic-laced words, viciously mocking him. 'Hey, I hear you like fish sticks!' WIS Save DC 13 or 2 Psychic damage and Disadvantage on its next attack: 21 The sahuagin doesn't fall for his tricks, though, he is no gay fish. Another BOOM from below: 28 The boards are flexing and giving, but not breaking yet. Mary , now much closer to the action than she prefers, poofs out of the fray and reappears farther to the rear of the ship like she's escaping a hug from a bard. She focuses a double blast of eldritch energy at #5: Attack: 15 Damage: 4 / Attack: 17 Damage: 5 Both hit, and trigger extra hex damage: 8 It crumples in a heap on the deck.

"Round 4: Sahuagin! (Pronounced: Sa-HOO-wa-gin) Dirk throws such a powerful chaos bolt at #2, its brain melts out of its ears from the psychic damage. Someone is going to have a rough cleanup later. ( AZ and Fjolnir may each move up to their speed if they use their reaction due to Dirk's Mantle of inspiration, and they gain 5 temp HP.)

"Fjolnir skitters further up the mast to try to get max height and angle on the Priestess, as he sets his concentration on her. 'Iffin whatever that thing down under the keel eats us, i'm cutting my way down it's gullet!', He barks to no one in particular. He draws two more arrows, bites the fletching short and looses them at the priestess, hoping his height minimizes water deflection. Longbow 18 dmg 5 Hunters Mark 4 Longbow 11 dmg 6 Hunters Mark 3"
"Az Emberi has to move around the guard to hit #4 as the rigging only goes about 10' from the mast in any direction but is able to move in, strike, and retreat away behind him. He would have taken an attack of opportunity if he didn't kill the sahuagin. Fjolnir Gets one arrow to stick but the other one passes between the priestess' arm and torso. The First Mate and Bosun fire at #3 and the priestess respectively: Attack: 24 Damage: 8 Attack: 5 Damage: 9 #3 is looking rough but the Bosun missed the priestess. The Priestess , surfacing to scream in pain and anger at the dwarf she continues to miss that has now pierced her with an arrow, uses the still floating spiritual trident to attack Fjolnir, along with casting Guiding Bolt at 3rd level: Attack: 22 Damage: 4 / Attack: 18 Damage: 25 The trident nearly knocks him off balance, then the Guiding Bolt hits him hard with radiant energy. Then she slinks underneath the ship. Fjolnir : Make 2 separate CON Saves to keep concentration on Hunter's Mark. The first DC 10, the Second DC 12. Another THUD is heard from below deck: 19 But no further damage is done. The last Sahuagin snarls and lashes out at one of the guards in a desperate attempt to kill one of the two on either side of him: Bite: Attack: 9 Damage: 3 Spear: Attack: 10 Damage: 8 But he misses with both strikes. In a panic, he dives overboard, taking two strikes from the guards around him: Attack: 20 Damage: 4 / Attack: 9 Damage: 4 One of them catches it with his spear and gashes open its side as it goes over the railing. it bleeds out, clouding the water with crimson. Absinthe is up! There are currently no targets above water. For reference, in case anyone decides to pursue underwater: A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points. Attacking Underwater: When making a melee weapon attack , a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart). Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.  19 Dirk 17 Dustfinger (C on Hex) 16 Guards 16 Sahuagin Baron 13 Captain & Keel Breaker (Taken 16 damage to underside) 12 Az Emberi 34+5/38 12 Fjolnir 30/54 (C on Hunter's Mark) 12 First Mate & Bosun 11 Sahuagin Priestess (1st: X 3rd: XX)(1st: X 2nd: XX 3rd: XX, Taken 9 damage) 10 Sahuagin 9 Absinthe 23/43 9 Garrett (1st [X][][][] / Inspirations: [X][X][]) 8 ??? 7 Mary (C on Hex, 3rd: [X][X]) 2 Gearbox"

"Looks like we have to go for a swim to finish this. Do we think these things are intelligent enough to negotiate at this point? Seriously, does someone want to dangle me over the side for a little powow fireside chat with Ariel's over caricature of an aunt? I mean we get it, you are the evil antagonist of the story but it wouldn't hurt to put on a little make up and do some situps once in a while AMIRIGHT? While I look to everyone for affirmation I am definitely looking at Mary, making that 'Come on, for reals though right?' face."
"Absinthe begins patrolling the waters from the safety of the ship. Looking at the damage to the crew and ship both on and off deck. 'I'm not a great swimmer, I don't know how much help I could be under water.'"
"Captain Miggetter chimes in, 'They're intelligent enough, lad, but too savage to care about yer lives. They don't speak common, and they'd just assume bite ya than look at ya. We kill them all, or we try to make it two more days with a giant battering ram trying to sink the ship!' Absinthe peers over the edge, but doesn't see anything. The spot under the boat being rammed is only barely visible from inside, but hasn't slowed down. Garrett holds a Vicious Mockery for any creature that would show itself, but doesn't do anything else. BOOM! 20 The boards flex upward below deck and return to their initial position. Mary says, 'I'm not going down there.' She holds an Eldritch Blast.

"Maybe it's a good day to die? I dive in to get a bead on this assailant, and light it up. L1 pink Faerie fire. 18 Wild magic."
"Dirk dives down to discover the source of so much banging. The ship's hull is not deep, and he very quickly catches a glimpse of it. Dirk, and anyone who jumps into the water on their turn: It's a shark. A big. ****ing. Shark. Like, easily swallow you in one gulp big. The two sahuagin priestesses next to it are dwarfed by it. It's about 30' long. You don't have enough movement to make it back to the surface this round unless you dash. I'll let you change your action if you want, no action needed if you're ok with staying in the water with what you posted. A flash of pink is seen from the depths. DEX Saves: 4 / 12 / 9 3 nopes. Dustfinger sighs and dives in as well. Attack: 26 Damage: 3 + 2 Dirk: He cast Eldritch Blast on the shark. The Guards do not follow suit, but hold for anything they might see.

Az emberi leaps over the side and transforms into a reef shark mid air.
"Fjolnir sighs miserably, draws another two arrows, bites the fletching off and jack knives into the water, loosing them at his still marked quarry- Longbow 12 dmg 4 Hunters Mark 2 Longbow 11 dmg 8 Hunters Mark 6"
"Az Emberi gracefully bounds over the railing and magically becomes a shark mid-fall, belly-flopping into the ocean with a giant splash and diving a few feet. Fjolnir joins the underwater party and fires a pair of arrows at the spell-slinging fish-person, and actually hits with both arrows. (Dirk's Faerie Fire would cancel out your disadvantage) She's looking rough. The First Mate and Bosun look at each other, then the captain, who nods, and they both jump off the side of the ship. They nearly shit themselves, then fire their arrows at the water-breathing beast. Attack: 10 Damage: 3 / Attack: 24 Damage: 7 one arrow catches it's side and grazes it. The Priestesses simultaneously shout something in fish-speak, and point at Dirk and Dustfinger. The Giant Shark, in response to this, turns in their direction... Then they each release a blast of radiant energy. #1 vs Dustfinger: 24 On Hit: 12 #2 vs Dirk: 15 On Hit: 14 #1 Crit: 10 Absinthe is up. 19 Dirk 18/32 17 Dustfinger 11/33 (C on Hex) 16 Guards (Holding Attacks) 16 Sahuagin Baron 13 Captain & Keel Breaker (Taken 96 damage to underside) 12 Az Emberi 34+5/38 12 Fjolnir 30/54 (C on Hunter's Mark) 12 First Mate & Bosun 11 Sahuagin Priestess #1 (1st: X 2nd: X 3rd: XX) (Faerie Fired) #2 (1st: X 2nd: XX 3rd: XXX, Taken 29 damage, looks rough) (Faerie Fired, Hunter's Marked) 10 Sahuagin 9 Absinthe 23/43 9 Garrett (1st [X][][][] / Inspirations: [X][X][]) Holding Vicious Mockery 8 Giant Shark (Taken 12 damage, Faerie Fired, Hex STR) 7 Mary (C on Hex, 3rd: [X][X]) Holding Eldritch Blast 2 Gearbox Holding Attack"
'OH! That's right I can swim!' Absinthe ssteps over the railing and Preforms what he hopes is a flawless dive. Athletics: 8 He enters the water as if superman flying into the ocean.
"Absinthe dives in but doesn't have much time to do much else. (I'll say you hold an attack since you didn't take an action) Garrett sighs and dives in after all of you, losing his held action since nothing showed itself to strike. His eyes widen at the sight of the giant shark, and he gathers his wits to somehow, even while underwater, throw a Vicious Mockery at Sahuagin Priestess #2, seeing her less than perfect physical state. WIS Save DC 13 or 1 psychic and (D) on next attack roll: 16 ...to no effect. Garrett then uses his last Bardic Inspiration on Dirk. The Giant Shark , frenzied by the scent of blood, speeds through the water at Dustfinger. Attack: 20 Damage: 23 Catching the warlock in its mouth, the shark tears into flesh, and Dustfinger passes out. He is now bleeding out and drowning and, needless to say, no longer concentrating on Hex. Mary , still not keen on jumping into the sea, looks over one side, and upon seeing nothing, moves across the ship to look over the other. She gasps and then throws a pair of Eldritch Blasts at the Giant Shark, after moving her Hex to it. Attack: 13 Damage: 10 + 6 / Attack: 23 Damage: 7 + 1 Thanks to the pink sparkle around the shark, she rips into it with both bolts of force, doing 24 total damage, yet it still looks unphased. Gearbox sees Mary attacking something and rushes to aid, also preferring not to get saltwater in places unseen, which would probably actually be detrimental to his inner workings. He lobs a javelin at the beast's head. Attack: 22 Damage: 5 The shark is now adorned with a javelin on the side of its face but seems to pay no mind. Dirk is up.  For orientation purposes, I placed the shark and priestesses atop the ship, but this is merely their underwater position. And yes, Priestess #1 is riding the shark! 19 Dirk 18/32 (d6 Bardic Inspiration) 17 Dustfinger 0/33 (Unconscious, Drowning, Death Saves: [][][]/[][][]) 16 Guards (Holding Attacks) 16 Sahuagin Baron 13 Captain & Keel Breaker (Taken 96 damage to underside) 12 Az Emberi 34+5/38 12 Fjolnir 30/54 (C on Hunter's Mark) 12 First Mate & Bosun 11 Sahuagin Priestess #1 (1st: X 2nd: X 3rd: XX) (Faerie Fired) #2 (1st: X 2nd: XX 3rd: XXX, Taken 29 damage, looks rough) (Faerie Fired, Hunter's Marked) 10 Sahuagin 9 Absinthe 23/43 (Holding melee attack) 9 Garrett (1st [X][][][] / Inspirations: [X][X][X]) 8 Giant Shark (Taken 41 damage, Faerie Fired, Hexed INT) 7 Mary (C on Hex, 3rd: [X][X]) 2 Gearbox"

"Round 6: Sahuagin! (Pronounced: Sa-HOO-wa-gin) Dirk rouses Dustfinger with a touch of healing and swims away after granting himself free movement and bonus HP. Dustfinger uses his granted movement and new lease on life to attempt to make it back to the ship. He uses his turn to climb up the side and back onto the deck. He fires off two blasts of eldritch energy: Attack: 21 Damage: 5 / Attack: 14 Damage: 2 The Guards all hold position, fearing their armor would drag them down if they jumped in, and watch helplessly from the deck.

"Az Emberi darts through the water, feeling natural in his new shark form, and bites the priestess in half. Fjolnir gets 2 arrows off at the other one, who is riding the shark, after moving his mark. Both hit the rider, for a total of 26 damage. The first mate and Bosun continue firing at the shark. Attack: 5 Damage: 8 / Attack: 11 Damage: 3 both miss due to the difficulty of firing underwater, even though the shark is glowing pink. The priestess atop the shark calls out to her fishy goddess, and brings forth a bolt of searing light through the water at Fjolnir, who just pelted her with arrows. Attack: 9 Damage: 20 but fails to connect with the powerful blow as Fjolnir swivels to the side.
