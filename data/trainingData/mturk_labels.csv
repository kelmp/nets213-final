"Currently, all of you on the top deck see a multitude of large shapes surrounding the boat underwater. They appear fish-like in their movement, yet they seem to have arm-like limbs or fins toward the front. It's impossible to make out any more details through the waves, but they are keeping pace with the boat. Absinthe and Dustfinger, as well as the rest of the crew below deck, hears the captain's call to arms. 10 14 19 Notes: The rigging can be climbed without making any kind of check, it is around the mast and will allow you to cross the center of the ship to get to the other side without going around. You can make a ranged attack against any one of the creatures if you're above deck and against that side of the ship, but since they're a few feet underwater it will be at disadvantage. There are 9 dark shapes underwater on either side of the boat. Let me know if you would like to start from a different location, you can be anywhere on the boat. There are 2 people operating each boat-mounted weapon. If there is ever not 2 people on a weapon, it will not be able to fire. Anyone may take the place of a weapon operator if they fall, but for the most part the other guards lined up along the sides of the deck will take care of that. Mary, Garrett, and Gearbox are on the map and will act on their turns. Anyone, on their turn, can call out what you want them to do as a free action, otherwise they will act to the best of their abilities. However, now that they are aiding the party they can be targeted. Captain Miggetter, His first mate and bosun are on the map.

"Dirk gives Absinthe a bit of healing. Dustfinger stands ready. Absinthe tries to get ahead and punch something, but the webbing proves difficult to move through. He holds his attack as well. The two spiders reappear, one behind Dustfinger and one between Absinthe and Fjolnir, but before they get to strike, Dustfinger, Absinthe and Hymir release their readied actions. Absinthe slashes at the one that appeared behind him: Attack: 20 Damage: 7 and makes a small gash across it's backside. Dustfinger's flourishing attack slices off a mandible. Hymir's Firebolt chars a section of exoskeleton. The first spider attacks Dustfinger: Attack: 19 Damage: 11 / 8 But hits and destroys one of his duplicates.
