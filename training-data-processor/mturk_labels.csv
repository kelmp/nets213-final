"Absinthe casually strolls out of the thicket back to the road, figuring this fight is over, and he's not going to catch the little chicken shit anyway. There's enough of the team throwing things at him, something has to hit. No, Absinthe 'Smashface' Stormbrew isn't really a closer. He doesn't chase cowards who refuse to stand their ground.
